			<title>The Conservative Con (Master Persuader Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t call myself well-informed about
				politics. But I pay attention when I can. My best guess is that I’m
				in the top 20% of informed citizens. Yet I don’t know the political
				definition
				of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;conservative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--
				more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither do you, in all
				likelihood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 2D filter of life,
				conservatives are united by a common ideology that is supported by
				reason. But under the Master Persuader filter,
				&lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; is a word created for the purpose of
				identity persuasion. Nothing more. According to my filter,
				&lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; has no logical or coherent reason
				for existing. While I assume it once had a noble birth, at this
				point it is just a hodgepodge of ideas that disagree with Democrats.
				Some of the individual ideas have merit, but they don’t belong
				together in the same bag for any reason that is obvious to
				me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I could not have said what I just
				said without being drummed off of the Internet. But Trump has laid
				bare the ridiculousness of the &lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt;
				label. In 2016, the word &lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; can be seen
				as a tool of influence &amp;ndash; a shaming tool &amp;ndash; used
				by the party elites to bring people together under their handpicked
				puppet. &lt;i&gt;Conservative&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t have a normal
				definition that is useful and widely understood. That’s why it works
				so well for persuasion. If it had a rigid definition, lots of people
				could find a reason to disagree. But by leaving the definition of
				&lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; in ambiguity, people see nothing
				with which they can disagree. That is classic
				persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump uses the same form of &lt;a
				href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140272615821/strategic-ambiguity-master-persuasion-series"&gt;strategic
				ambiguity&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you
				will write coherent definitions of conservatism in the comments. I’m
				sure that definition exists. But if you walk out on the street and
				ask random Republicans to define what conservative means, they will
				probably say something about “small government” before voting for
				whoever is likely to increase its size, such as any of the
				Republican candidates still in the
				race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has tried to game
				the system by labelling himself a “common sense conservative.” When
				you add &lt;i&gt;common sense&lt;/i&gt; to the front of
				&lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; you can effectively drop the
				conservative part. Trump correctly treats the word
				&lt;i&gt;conservative&lt;/i&gt; as a throw-away, because it is. It
				has no independent meaning in people’s minds.
				&lt;i&gt;Conservative&lt;/i&gt; is a word used by con men to
				maintain their power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Is Marco Rubio correct
				that Trump is a “con man”? Yes, Rubio is 100% right. Trump is a con
				man in a party of con people running against another party of con
				people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s just better at
				it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. - What is a
				&lt;i&gt;progressive&lt;/i&gt;? I have no idea what that is either.
				Same argument applies. It is a word of persuasion, not reason. You
				can test that by adding “common sense” to the front of it and seeing
				that &lt;i&gt;progressive&lt;/i&gt; instantly becomes the throw-away
				part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>The Power of Ideas</title>

				It’s on the second page, between Forbes and CBS news. I noticed

			<title>Republican Debate (March 3) Scorecard (Master Persuader
				Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The FOX News debate moderators annihilated
				Donald Trump last night. They highlighted huge problems with his
				budget plan, showed inconsistencies in his policies, and hammered
				him for his Trump University &amp;ldquo;scam” as some would call it.
				It was Trump’s first bad debate night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when I say FOX annihilated Trump, I mean they
				guaranteed a Trump landslide. People don’t like the establishment,
				in case you haven’t heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re past the question
				of whether our politicians are lying to us. That’s a given. The
				system forces them to lie to get elected. I’m not sure the voters
				care at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good way to judge the
				persuasiveness of these debates is to sleep on them and see what
				sticks in your mind in the morning. The few moments that you
				remember are the things that matter. The rest of your memories got
				flushed while you slept. So Here’s what I recall from last
				night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Trump’s penis is more than adequate, he
				says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Trump’s immigration plans are his first
				offer, subject to negotiation, as I have been telling you for
				months. (Because all things are subject to
				negotiation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Trump has no good defense for the
				Trump University “scam” accusation. But voters probably don’t care.
				They heard it was a contested legal situation &amp;ndash; a boring
				one &amp;ndash; and that was probably enough for people to ignore
				it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Trump’s budget plans are ridiculous, just
				like the other candidates’ plans. But voters probably know that
				already. No one believes a budget plan from a
				candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Trump looked sweaty and flustered at
				one point. That’s the first we have seen it. But he still came off
				as powerful in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich
				were also on stage. I can’t remember if they
				talked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. FOX seemed to be piling on Trump, but
				that could be the front-runner effect. You expect them to go after
				the leader and frame questions around the leader’s
				positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I doubt this debate moved the
				needle much on the polls. People who watch debates at this point in
				the election cycle probably made up their minds before they turned
				on the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering how to make a
				decision in light of the fact that all the candidates appear to be
				either deeply flawed or toothless, I’m here to help. I suggest you
				use this simple trick: Assume all the accusations about everyone are
				100% true. Then vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, assume Donald
				Trump has changed positions on some things and plans to negotiate on
				other things. Assume he has a ridiculous budget plan. Assume he has
				insufficient policy details. Assume his taxes have some ugly
				surprises and that Trump University seemed a scam to its students.
				Assume he has several notable business failures. Assume he has
				offensive thoughts about women and minorities and he will say more
				offensive things in the future. Assume he is a narcissist too.
				Assume all of it to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also remember
				that Trump has never offered himself to be the country’s role model.
				And I don’t believe anyone is questioning his patriotism or love of
				country. As far as I can tell, Trump is treating this more like an
				extended job interview. He’s offering to put his talent for
				persuasion (which you might call his flaw of being full of shit) in
				the service of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Trump presidency
				would be messy. It would certainly introduce a new type of risk that
				we have not seen before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want more
				risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you want to avoid risk
				when things are going well and accept risk when things are totally
				broken. If you think the country is doing well, and will continue to
				do so, Hillary Clinton is an excellent choice on the left, as is
				Marco Rubio on the right. They will keep things mostly the
				same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you think government is rigged
				against your interests, and unlikely to improve on its own, you want
				a bloodless revolution. And the candidate you hire for the
				revolution is likely to have rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I
				remind you that I’m not endorsing Trump or anyone else. In fact, I
				disavowed Trump exactly because of the rough edges. I don’t want to
				be in the splatter zone with any of the accusations I
				mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>A Letter to Donald Trump (from a voter, not me)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This letter from Troy Morton was in the
				comments to my post from earlier today. I am reposting it here, with
				permission, because it is simply
				beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathtaking,
				actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To: President
				Trump&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From: Just a simple
				man&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following your campaign
				since your announcement, reading millions of words written about
				you, watching thousands of hours of video and speeches, listening to
				many talk radio show segments, and engaging in dozens of debates
				with people around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No candidate has ever
				captured my attention the way you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that
				it&amp;rsquo;s clear you will be the Republican nominee, I want to
				share with you something so personal, painful, and uplifting, that I
				almost don&amp;rsquo;t want to write it, but I will
				anyway&amp;hellip;trolls be damned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My whole life,
				up until yesterday, has been based on reaction to
				fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up as a black man in Washington D.C.
				during the &amp;ldquo;crack 80&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;, when Marion
				Barry was mayor, I lived a lower middle class childhood in one of
				the most dangerous cities in America. Though I had many friends, I
				was also subject to the threats, intimidation, and bullying that
				happens when you&amp;rsquo;re not like the people around
				you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no father in my life to steel me
				against the world I lived in. My mother was strong, but
				it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the kind of strength I needed. I was a
				boy, and needed a Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without strong male
				guidance, I learned to fear&amp;hellip;but not how to face fear and
				win. Even joining the military and going to war didn&amp;rsquo;t
				overcome my weakness, and all my future decisions considered
				strongly the level of fear I had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a
				result, my life has been full of conflict, as I have unintentionally
				signaled to adversaries that I am an easier opponent to beat than
				others. I have won victories, but never truly enjoyed them knowing
				the battle is never won for me&amp;hellip;only endured. I have also
				suffered crushing defeats, and important people in my life lost
				confidence in me as a result. I have not reached my potential, and
				settled instead into apathy and stasis, content to only being
				&amp;ldquo;smart enough&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;good
				enough&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;not great. Not strong. Not
				resolute&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a leader. Not a
				winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life, in many important ways, mirrors
				the American experience. Potential to be great, but paralyzed by
				fear. Full of conflict. Enduring, not winning. No leadership. No
				strong Male inspiration. And occasional, crushing defeats that hit
				to the core of our country&amp;hellip;most notably 9/11, but also
				with the erosion of our middle class and uniquely American
				culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like you say so often: we don&amp;rsquo;t
				WIN anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching your campaign, and being as
				invested in it as I am, has been an exercise in recognizing, and
				confronting, fear that I never expected. Every time your opponents
				hit you&amp;hellip;I feel fear for your candidacy and our country.
				Every charge of racist, sexist, facist, etc. causes me to worry that
				no one, not even you, can really change the country for the better.
				That we&amp;rsquo;re doomed to
				failure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;hellip;inevitably&amp;hellip;you
				win the battle. You don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;survive&amp;rdquo;,
				or &amp;ldquo;endure&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;you attack, and put fear
				into your opponents. You don&amp;rsquo;t stop until they are buried
				under your feet. Until they become
				paralyzed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you even bait
				them into hitting you, just so you can beat the crap out of them
				again. Your life is full of conflict, but it becomes yet another
				opportunity to WIN, and makes you MORE powerful&amp;hellip;not
				less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, once they are eliminated as a threat,
				you are generous to the vanquished. It&amp;rsquo;s not personal, and
				they are not evil. They were, simply&amp;hellip;in the way. Once
				they are not, they become worthy of kindness and
				respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you&amp;rsquo;re not just a
				blunt instrument&amp;hellip;your strategy is impeccable. You go into
				every conflict knowing exactly what your opponents weaknesses are,
				how to exploit them, and what levers to pull to ensure victory.
				Clearly, you spend good time before announcing your candidacy doing
				the things the military taught me as a young soldier: surveying,
				recon, intelligence-gathering, ammunition, discipline,
				execution&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are defending America
				from our enemies within, and it&amp;rsquo;s an AMAZING thing to
				watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, you also did something else.
				You became the Man that helped me see fear for what it is: an
				illusion of power, a powerful teacher, and the path to winning if
				used properly. There is no reason, regardless of the enormity of the
				task, to lose to fear if you prepare well, are disciplined in your
				execution, and have the faith necessary, in God, yourself, and in
				others&amp;hellip;that leads to victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning
				is always possible, but becomes probable if you never back down,
				never quit, and become your dominant self. Once the battle is won,
				treat the vanquished with kindness and respect. Be the bigger
				man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You taught me how to Win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
				appreciate what you&amp;rsquo;ve done for me personally, and what
				you&amp;rsquo;re doing for our country. I know I&amp;rsquo;m not the
				only man who admires you, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you to become
				the father, and leader, of our country. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long,
				cold winter for men in America the last 8 years, and I believe that
				your election will dramatically improve the level of respect,
				admiration, and love people will show for strong men and Fathers,
				and will create a new generation of leaders from impressionable
				young boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, more than anything, will Make
				America Great
				Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Troy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
				you liked Troy’s letter, there is no reason to believe you would
				also like my &lt;a
				href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1376677690&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.
				But if you did, it would be two examples of good taste on your part,
				and that might be enough to fool your
				friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what
				Troy’s letter did to my blog traffic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

			<title>Super Tuesday (Master Persuader Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump did well in the Super Tuesday
				primary states, surprising no one who reads this blog. Here are my
				thoughts about last night, as seen through the Master Persuader
				filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates who win
				primaries usually do a little victory speech the same night. Trump
				turned his brief remarks into an extended press conference that had
				all the optics of a sitting president. He called on reporters, took
				hard questions, and swatted them away like King Kong at the top of
				the Empire State building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, he made
				you think past the sale. Your rational mind knows Trump is not yet
				president, and yet you observe Trump looking and acting like a
				sitting president. When it comes to persuasion, visuals beat reason.
				This was one of Trump’s best 3D chess moves so
				far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was obvious that Trump was trying to
				showcase his moderate, non-scary side &amp;ndash; so the public
				knows he has one &amp;ndash; and by most accounts he succeeded. I
				thought he succeeded as well. His statements about supporting
				women&amp;rsquo;s health in the context of Planned Parenthood
				funding &amp;ndash; against the grain of his own party &amp;ndash;
				were especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s impromptu press
				conference was insanely brilliant. CNN probably lost money because
				they couldn’t take a commercial break until he was done, and he was
				in no hurry. It was the longest free political commercial of all
				time, and the best possible format for Trump. It was also riveting
				because you didn’t know what would happen
				next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other formats &amp;ndash; such as
				debates and normal press interviews &amp;ndash; Trump completely
				dominated the stage and the reporters. He made them raise their
				hands to talk, then he interrupted when he didn’t like the question,
				and dismissed the trouble-makers with their long, repetitive,
				damning questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of all, Trump got to do
				some disavowing of David Duke in front of the world. And this time
				he did it right. The first words out of his mouth this time were “I
				disavow.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is good technique. A Master
				Persuader says &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIRST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the thing
				he wants you to remember. Then he explains why. If you do those
				things in reverse order &amp;ndash; which is a common error
				&amp;ndash; you get a hot mess. Good persuaders start with the
				conclusion first &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;in this sort of
				situation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Bad persuaders give the
				&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reasoning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; first and work
				toward the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this
				blog know that laughter can be a tell for persuasion. As I watched
				Trump’s press conference, I found myself giggling without an obvious
				cause. I’ll bet some of you did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris
				Christie did his best impression of Trump’s future vice president,
				but he seemed physically uncomfortable on stage when Trump was
				speaking. I think he was either exhausted or not feeling well. The
				Internet was not kind to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now you know
				there is a rumor that the New York Times has a recording of Trump
				acting reasonable about his deportation plans. When asked about it
				at his “press conference,” Trump said he was not contemplating any
				compromise “at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Trump
				said he would &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; compromise,
				but he did so in language that assures you it is an option for
				later. Everyone gets to hear what they want. That’s &lt;a
				href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140272615821/strategic-ambiguity-master-persuasion-series"&gt;strategic
				ambiguity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s Super Tuesday
				dominance gives him a solid lead. But his impromptu press conference
				was Trump showing us what his afterburners will look like when he
				fires them up for the general election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You
				haven’t seen anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might wonder what
				it’s like to be me, and to see the future so clearly in this
				particular case. The answer is that this is my normal, so yesterday
				just seemed like Tuesday to me. When you learn enough about the
				science of persuasion, the mysteries of life start to fall away. A
				good start on that journey is my &lt;a

			<title>Strategic Ambiguity (Master Persuasion Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been watching the news lately you
				know that Donald Trump disavowed the endorsement of racist David
				Duke. Unless you are watching CNN, in which case, their version of
				the news is that he didn’t do enough disavowing that one
				time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a racist, you
				have a reason to like Trump because of CNN’s intentional
				misreporting and the fact that Trump didn’t do enough disavowing
				that one time. If you’re &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; a
				racist, you can like Trump because he disavowed racists several
				times, in writing and on video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hate socialized healthcare, you
				might like Trump, because he hates socialized medicine too. Except
				that he also says he won’t let people with no money “die on the
				streets.” So if you like socialized medicine, you might like giving
				free healthcare to those people, like
				Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hate illegal immigrants, you
				might like Trump because he says he will deport every one of them.
				But if you feel compassion for illegal immigrants who are otherwise
				good residents of the country, you know Trump always makes a big
				first offer and will later negotiate to something humane and
				reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you oppose war, you might like Trump
				because he opposed the Iraq war and has a history of being reluctant
				to commit U.S. forces overseas. But if you think the U.S. should
				keep bombing other countries, Trump might be your candidate because
				he wants to bomb the shit out of ISIS and maybe kill some of their
				families too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a religious president,
				Trump can give you that. He has belonged to a church since youth and
				says the Bible is a great book. But if you don’t like mixing
				religion and politics, Trump might be your candidate because he
				hasn’t made a big deal about religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s
				strategic ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could go on like this for
				another hour or so, but I think you get the picture. And when you
				see the pattern, you realize none of it is by accident. Trump
				intentionally gives opposing sides reasons to like him, or at least
				not disqualify him. And as ridiculous as it seems for a strategy, it
				works like a charm because of &lt;a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"&gt;confirmation
				bias&lt;/a&gt;. People see whatever they want to
				see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be aware that I have been saying
				good things about Donald Trump’s persuasion skills for months. This
				has led many people to believe I endorse Trump for
				president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But earlier this week &lt;a
				href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140155514891/disavowing-trump"&gt;I
				disavowed Trump&lt;/a&gt; for his strategic ambiguity on racism. So
				if you hate Trump, you can be okay with me because I disavowed him.
				And if you love Trump you can be okay with me because I say good
				things about his talent on a regular
				basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you know why I disavowed Trump for
				not disavowing racism hard enough that one time even though he
				clearly disavowed it before and after the time he did not disavow it
				so clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facts were never important to me.
				I ignored the facts publicly and shamelessly because doing so
				provided me the best possible outcome: strategic
				ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Trump wins big today for Super
				Tuesday, as polls predict, I will be one of the few pundits who saw
				it coming last year. And if Trump stumbles, today or soon, I already
				removed myself from the splatter zone by disavowing
				him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Scarborough made the &lt;a
				href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/29/media/joe-scarborough-donald-trump-david-duke/"&gt;same
				play that I did&lt;/a&gt;, presumably for the same reason.
				Scarborough had been labelled as &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;too
				supportive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of Trump because &amp;ndash; like me
				&amp;ndash; he recognized Trump’s persuasion talent before most of
				the herd. So Scarborough fixed his problem the same way I did, with
				some strategic ambiguity. Now you’re not so sure which side he is
				on, if any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that two people who
				saw Trump’s persuasion skills early (Scarborough and me) both took
				the same strategy and opportunity to generate strategic ambiguity
				for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t watched Scarborough
				enough to know if he has Master Persuader skills, but I’ve got my
				eye on him now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today will be fun. I might be on
				&lt;a href="https://www.periscope.tv/"&gt;Periscope&lt;/a&gt; later
				tonight watching the primary results if you want to say
				hi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Trump’s VP Options (Master Persuader Filter)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, let’s say Trump has five options
				for VP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;John
				Kasich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some other white male
				governor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Superstar woman or minority
				governor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark
				Cuban&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chris
				Christie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll break down
				the choices for you and run them through the Master Persuader filter
				for a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal
				elections, the party nominee picks a VP running mate that can help
				win an important state. But Trump is likely to run the table without
				that specific kind of help. Instead, Trump needs some legitimacy
				around the hard work of governing and cajoling congress. Trump says
				that directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Master Persuader Filter, I
				see the options this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;John
				Kasich:&lt;/b&gt; Too boring. Trump would prefer a candidate who can
				suck all the energy away from the other VP choice. Kasich is too
				safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some other White, Male
				Governor:&lt;/b&gt; Unlikely for the same reason that Kasich is. No
				sizzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Superstar woman or minority
				governor:&lt;/b&gt; This option has the sizzle, but could a woman or
				minority credibly side with Trump? I don’t think so. And the media
				would do nothing but ask that person how he or she could be on
				Trump’s team. It would be a distraction. And it would seem more
				pandering than straight-shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark
				Cuban:&lt;/b&gt; Cuban would be my first choice for Trump VP, but he
				adds nothing in terms of governing experience. Worse yet, the media
				would keep saying Cuban should be running for president instead of
				Trump. That is not a comparison Trump wants. But if he decided to
				take a chance on that comparison, a Trump/Cuban ticket would be
				unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris Christie:&lt;/b&gt; If
				you think about it, Christie is the poor man’s Trump. He has plenty
				of sizzle &amp;ndash; just short of Trump’s wattage &amp;ndash; and
				he reinforces the straight-talking, hard-ass approach of Trump. This
				is an ideal comparison for Trump. Relatively few people would say
				the ticket should be reversed with Christie on top. And Christie is
				sufficiently experienced to take over the presidency if needed. I
				assume they could work well together. Many asses would be
				kicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think that a Trump/Christie
				ticket would alienate the South and the West. But Trump has shown
				strength everywhere, so that is less of an issue than it would be in
				a normal election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Master Persuader filter
				says Trump will pick Christie. I put the odds at
				70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For new readers, I disavowed Trump so I can
				stay out of the splatter zone. But I still predict he will win the
				presidency in a landslide that will make history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Movie Persuasion Recommendations</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been following my Master Persuader
				series, and you want to learn more about persuasion by watching
				great movies, I give you two suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spotlight:&lt;/b&gt; This movie is about The
				Boston Globe’s investigation into the Catholic Church’s pattern of
				protecting priests accused of molesting children. The persuasion
				angle is watching how all of the characters (taken from real life)
				rationalize their behaviors. It is also a terrific movie in its own
				right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Big Short:&lt;/b&gt; This
				movie is about the few people who saw the financial market meltdown
				of 2009 before it happened and couldn’t convince other “experts”
				that the signs were there. Cognitive dissonance at its
				finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I resisted watching The Big Short because
				I heard that Steve Carrell played a character that is a jerk with
				anger issues. I didn’t think that would work. But he totally nails
				it. Great movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, those movies show
				you that large organizations filled with smart people are generally
				corrupt whenever the stakes are high, the odds of getting caught are
				low, and the opportunity exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how you
				know the caucuses and primaries are probably rigged to some extent.
				If they are not rigged at all &amp;ndash; even a little &amp;ndash;
				it might be the only time in human history that there was
				opportunity, a big upside, low odds of detection, and yet no foul
				play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s your red line between conspiracy
				theory and gullibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Dilbert’s Changed Look Explained</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dilbert will look different the next six
				weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t taken a day off from work for
				about three years, and my drawing hand needed some rest and rehab.
				So I asked my &amp;ldquo;coworkers” (at &lt;a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?q=universal+uclick&amp;amp;oq=universal+uclick&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3326j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=119&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Universal
				Uclick&lt;/a&gt;) to fill in for me while I try to figure out how
				vacations work. (The alternative was running
				repeats.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My instructions to the guest artist were
				that I would do the writing and they were free to draw Dilbert in
				their own style, or to copy mine as best they could. You will see
				six different Dilbert styles in six weeks. This first week is drawn
				by the President of Universal Uclick, John Glynn. The last week in
				the series will be drawn by an intern. So&amp;hellip;expect every
				week to be better than the one before :-).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
				names of the vacation artists are between the
				panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan to bring in
				guest artists from among my readers to write and draw Dilbert for a
				week turned out to be problematic for a variety of boring reasons.
				So I apologize for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I welcome any
				of you who were interested in that opportunity to post your own
				comics in the comments section here. At least you’ll get a lot of
				viewers, and maybe something good can come out of it. (Consider it a
				system, not a goal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Disavowing Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I disavow Trump. Because of &lt;a
				href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/28/politics/donald-trump-white-supremacists/index.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
				and a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His skills are still
				impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update
				1:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, what I’m doing
				here is getting out of the splatter zone. I am aware that Trump has
				disavowed David Duke and the KKK in the past and I am certain he
				will do more of it. But any ambiguity on this topic is his problem,
				not mine. I’ll let him sort it out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know
				who would do the best job as president. That’s a separate question.
				The leaders in the polls all seem to have deep
				flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update
				2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2D world of reason it makes no
				sense to disavow someone I never avowed in the first place for not
				disavowing someone else when in fact the person I disavowed
				&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;did&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; disavow that other person.
				(Got it?) But I don’t live in the 2D world. In my world, association
				is more important than reason. And this is a good opportunity to
				disassociate my brand from Trump’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve said
				repeatedly in this blog that I don’t know who would be the best
				president. But all of my Trump blogging created an association that
				translated in people’s minds to an endorsement. Disavowing him
				solves for that at small transactional cost to me (some extra
				hatred). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does it matter that the reasons for my
				disavowal makes no sense to others? Yes, in the sense that it is the
				very thing that will make you remember that I disavowed him. (I
				taught you that trick in &lt;a
				href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/129348531446/when-wives-attack-trump-persuasion-series"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
				post. As Trump shows us time and time again, wrongness gets your
				attention and reason does not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll still blog
				about Trump’s persuasion skills but I’ll let him do his own
				explaining about race relations, Trump University, and his
				multi-level marketing business for vitamins that didn’t work out. I
				prefer disavowing all of that to keep the stink off of
				me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick thought experiment: Assume
				every bad accusation about &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
				of the candidates is 100% true. Then watch in awe as it doesn’t
				change your opinion on who you support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all
				want a saint-like president with brilliant and rational policies,
				but a saint would never make it through the
				primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>The Choke Artist Versus the Watch Salesman (Trump Persuasion
				Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare Trump’s and Rubio’s Linguistic
				Kill Shots from the &lt;a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?q=republican+debate&amp;amp;oq=republican+debate&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.2742j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=119&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Republican
				debate last night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m ignoring Cruz today because he seemed to be
				arguing his case to a bored jury. He wasn’t terribly interesting
				last night. He seemed lawyerly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio showed a new
				feisty side at the debate, going after Trump for hiring illegal
				Polish workers 35 years ago through a subcontractor, pointing out
				Trump’s notable business failures, saying Trump would be selling
				watches in Manhattan if he had not inherited wealth, and mocking
				Trump’s healthcare plan that is light on details. Rubio also
				called-out Trump for repeating himself during the debate. Trump
				seemed on the defensive more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio’s
				debate grade: A+&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was all good stuff. I don’t
				know if Rubio got a new advisor or just decided this was the time to
				put it all out there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robot Rubio? Gone. He was
				replaced by feisty Rubio. That’s a big deal, and
				well-executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had his worst debate in terms
				of how much time was spent on topics that are bad for Trump. In the
				past, Trump’s magic involved making the public focus on the
				weaknesses of his opponents. Rubio flipped that around with his
				flurry of quotable attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for
				Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump tested a new Linguistic Kill Shot for
				Rubio, calling him a “choke artist” for freezing up on stage at the
				last debate. As always, Trump’s engineered kill shots have the
				following qualities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The insult is a type you
				haven’t heard before in politics. I call it a &lt;i&gt;fresh
				field&lt;/i&gt; insult. That allows Trump to imbue it with his own
				meaning. The words “choke artist” do not remind you of anyone else
				in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Adding “artist” to choke makes you
				think past the sale. The sale is whether Rubio is a choker. Your
				brain accepts that truth in order to process whether or not Rubio is
				an artist at choking or just a regular choker. (I’ll bet you missed
				that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. It took about ten seconds for Twitter
				users to realize that “choke artist” reminded them of a sexual act
				that sometimes happens after the &lt;a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rubio+foam+party&amp;amp;oq=rubio+foam+party&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2671j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=119&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;foam
				party&lt;/a&gt; at the gay nightclub. And let’s say the “artist” in
				this case is not the one standing upright. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the
				interest of context, you need to know that bad people on the
				Internet have been trying to get the Rubio-is-gay rumor going for
				months. I’ve avoided that topic until now because you can’t write
				&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;about&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; it without becoming part
				of it. For the record, I doubt Rubio is gay, but maybe he
				experimented with some Koch contributions in college. Personally, I
				think having another gay president would be kinda cool. &lt;a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?q=was+lincoln+gay&amp;amp;oq=was+lincoln+gay&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3078j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=119&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Lincoln
				did okay&lt;/a&gt;. But the gay rumor about Rubio might have an
				impact on Republican voters who are not aware of how much their
				beloved Abe Lincoln loved logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Deniability.
				Trump didn’t say Rubio is gay. All he said is that Rubio got sweaty
				and froze up during a debate. Any other interpretation is your own.
				As far as you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s compare Rubio’s and
				Trump’s linguistic kill shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio went after
				Trump’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which in
				this case is Trump’s reputation as a skilled business operator. That
				was good strategy and he did it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump,
				however, went after Rubio’s
				&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;weaknesses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, by mentioning his
				choking under pressure. Trump’s Linguistic Kill Shot &amp;ndash; as
				always &amp;ndash; matches the physicality of his opponent, not
				exclusively his behavior. (Rubio attacked only Trump’s
				behavior.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also alerted the press and the
				public to be looking for any examples of future Rubio choking. Now
				that we are looking for it, we are likely to find it even in places
				it does not exist. If Rubio makes even the smallest speaking miscue
				&amp;ndash; as all people do &amp;ndash; we are primed see it as
				choking. Advantage: Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, Trump’s
				Linguistic Kill Shot has weapons-grade engineering (as usual)
				whereas Rubio’s attacks were a festival of A-B testing. Rubio threw
				everything at Trump and waited to see what would stick. Phase 2 will
				be hitting the sticky stuff hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t
				compare Rubio’s A-B testing to Trump’s finished Linguistic Kill
				Shot. That’s apples and oranges. But Rubio did set himself up to get
				stronger once he knows what works best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most
				observers, including me, believe Rubio’s good night was a case of
				too little and too late. I think that’s probably right. But the one
				thing we know for sure is that Rubio will not be Trump’s VP choice.
				That option died last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>How to Spot a Narcissist (Trump Persuasion Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is the most famous narcissist in
				the world. That fact probably seems obvious to you, given Trump’s
				continuous self-promotion. Mental health experts agree with your
				assessment. Trump hits most of the checkboxes for the
				diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest tell for
				narcissism is a belief that you are better than other people. For
				example, if Trump believed he could run for President &amp;ndash;
				with almost no political experience &amp;ndash; and dominate the
				Republican party in only a few short months, that would be an
				example of&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, wait. That one
				doesn’t work. Apparently his self-image was spot-on in that one
				specific case. It was the rest of us who got that one
				wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But still, Trump obviously has an inflated
				self-image. For example, there was the time he thought he could
				transition from being a real estate developer to being a
				best-selling author of a book about negotiating, but
				then&amp;hellip;shit. Okay, that example doesn’t
				work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, how about this example: Remember when
				Trump thought he could transition from developing real estate and
				being a best selling author to becoming a reality TV star and
				then&amp;hellip;okay, forget that one. That sort of worked out for
				Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Um&amp;hellip;okay, I have one. Remember
				all of the Trump real estate and casino businesses that failed? I
				think there were a handful of big failures. That’s a
				&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; track record when you
				consider Trump’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;hundreds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of
				successful projects that&amp;hellip;shit. Okay, that example doesn’t
				work when you put it in context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ego on
				that guy. For example, Trump thinks
				&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;models&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are attracted to him.
				Models! Ha ha! And they are, but my point is that I forget what my
				point is. Something about his ego? Yes, that’s
				it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Trump thinks he is smarter than most
				people just because he has a high IQ and went to great schools.
				Usually that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mean you are
				smarter than 98% of the public, but in this case it was probably
				just luck, because obviously all of us are smarter than Trump. I
				mean, look at his haircut!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissists also seek
				attention from others. That is Trump all over! Compare his
				attention-seeking ways to other people who license their brands for
				a living. Those other people like to stay quiet or maybe say their
				brand is not so good. That is what good mental health looks like.
				But narcissist Trump actually promotes his brand every chance he
				gets, which is gross. Sure, it makes him a lot of money, but
				capitalism is about more than that. For example, something about the
				Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, unlike Trump, the other candidates
				for President of the United States do not seek attention. Okay,
				technically they are seeking it as hard as they can, and failing.
				But to me, that seems exactly the same as not
				trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is more than having an
				over-inflated ego and a need for attention. Narcissists also lack
				empathy. That’s Trump all over. He has no empathy whatsoever. Sure,
				he &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;says&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; he loves wounded
				veterans, underemployed Americans, and even the undereducated. But
				you know all of that is lies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know?
				Simple! You know because you are far smarter than normal people. You
				might be an unrecognized genius, given your modesty. Maybe you’re
				not the test-taking kind of genius, but you are definitely a beacon
				of common sense. For example, you know for sure which candidate
				would be the best president while idiots like me can only guess. In
				fact, you are so smart that you can peer into Trump’s soul from a
				distance and see his lack of empathy. Impressive! And, I might add
				that you are an ace at diagnosing mental conditions despite your
				total lack of training in the field. You, my friend, are indeed
				better than other people because you see Trump for the
				over-inflated, uncaring buffoon that he is. And unlike Trump, you do
				not seek attention. So don’t leave a comment below to showcase your
				brilliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is definitely a thing. But
				we also need a name for the mental condition in which you believe
				you are so smart you can diagnose narcissism from a
				distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t call you a narcissist unless
				you state your opinion in a public comment forum and insult other
				voters and commenters as if you have no empathy. So don’t do
				that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you liked
				this blog post, there is no reason to think you would also like my
				&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1NOjdMo"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on a different
				topic. But you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Some Respect for Hillary Clinton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This election cycle has produced some
				spectacular entertainment. But it has also produced (already)
				spectacular benefits for the country. It would be easy to miss those
				benefits. I’ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;For
				starters, we no longer assume a non-politician can’t get nominated
				for a major party. Trump seems on the way to do that. That probably
				improves our options for future races. I assume we will see more of
				it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Trump demolished political
				correctness &amp;ndash; at least for now &amp;ndash; and that might
				give us more options in dealing with immigration and other thorny
				problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think Hillary Clinton gets my
				vote for having the biggest accomplishment. And I’ll bet that
				accomplishment is invisible to you, the same way a magician uses
				misdirection to render the real trick invisible. I’ll give you the
				misdirection first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton has been
				transparent in saying that one of the benefits she can bring to the
				presidency is her gender. As President Obama did for racial
				perceptions, Clinton can do for gender. It would be a tremendous
				moment in history to swear in the first woman
				president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the misdirection. You missed
				the actual trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick is that Hillary
				Clinton has &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;already accomplished the gender
				breakthrough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. There really isn’t anything left
				to prove, gender-wise. Any doubts that people have about Clinton are
				related to her character and track record. Her gender isn’t even in
				the conversation as a potential negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton
				made that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, you might hear some
				whispered sexism at parties. There’s always the guy with too many
				cocktails saying Clinton will have a hot flash and unleash the
				nuclear arsenal. But that guy is drunk. And people say worse things
				about Obama a million times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point is
				that Hillary Clinton &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;already won the gender
				war&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. She removed gender from the conversation
				about the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about
				that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton, through her life’s work
				and achievements, has made the idea of “woman president” almost seem
				like the past. The young women supporting Bernie Sanders probably
				don’t think breaking the presidential glass ceiling is even a thing.
				It feels pre-broken, by Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Obama was
				running for his first term, much of the pundit conversation was
				about racism and whether or not enough of the other races would
				support him. But have you heard much in the mainstream media about
				Clinton’ gender being a negative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You haven’t.
				Because it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton did
				that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consider this to be one of history’s
				greatest accomplishments. Hillary Clinton took gender out of the
				conversation (except trivially) for the highest office in the
				land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticize Hillary Clinton for other things,
				but you have to give her credit for leveling the presidential
				playing field forever. It might be some time before another woman
				makes a strong run for the office, but only because there are fewer
				women in the pipeline. The question of gender-related competence is
				settled. Now it is about the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit
				Clinton for that improvement in society, whether she wins or loses.
				The change is permanent. That deserves respect. She has mine, in
				this one way at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>Solving for Scary (Trump Persuasion Series)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump looks like a good bet to win the
				Republican nomination. And let’s say his opponent in the general
				election is either Clinton or Sanders. That gives us an interesting
				situation in which the three candidates in the best position to
				become president have fatal
				flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is too
				scary &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton is too
				untrustworthy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders is too
				non-religious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2D world of politics, voters say they look at
				the issues and choose the candidate with the best platform. In the
				3D world of persuasion, so long as a candidate isn’t bat-shit crazy,
				personality always beats policy details. So the question comes down
				to which of the three candidates can solve for their perceived
				personality flaws. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Trump finds a
				way to be less scary, he wins. If Clinton finds a way to be more
				trusted, she wins. If Sanders accepts Jesus as his personal savior,
				he wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t see any scenario in which Clinton
				regains trust or Sanders turns to Jesus. But Trump probably has
				several solutions to fix his scariness problem. Let’s talk about how
				he can do that and win in a landslide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have
				already seen Trump modulate his personality to fit any circumstance.
				He fights when he needs to fight, but he also shows empathy
				&amp;ndash; with wounded veterans, for example &amp;ndash; when the
				situation calls for it. Trump says clearly and often that he changes
				his approach to fit the situation. But can he change his approach
				enough to stop scaring the pants off of
				Democrats? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider writer and pundit &lt;a
				href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/10/10956978/donald-trump-terrifying"&gt;Ezra
				Klein&lt;/a&gt;. That poor guy is so terrified (to use his word) of
				Trump that he is peeing himself to sleep every night thinking about
				it. The fear is real, even if the justification for the fear is not.
				Can Trump overcome that level of deep, deep fear in
				Democrats?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, and probably with
				ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all expect Trump to act less scary in the
				general election once he has the nomination. A few months of acting
				non-racist, peppered with some spontaneous acts of public empathy
				should help. But it won’t be enough. What Trump needs is a VP
				running mate who solves for his scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has
				said he prefers a real politician for a running mate, to balance out
				his own lack of government experience. That makes some sense, but it
				gives you a boring running mate and no solution for the Trump
				scariness factor. A normal politician would simply disappear in
				Trump’s shadow. Maybe that’s what Trump wants. But it doesn’t solve
				for scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve for scary, Trump needs Mark
				Cuban as his running mate. Cuban has evolved from saying Trump has
				no chance of winning to saying he is interested in being VP (sort
				of, maybe), as long as his family is okay with it. See some links
				&lt;a
				href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Mark+Cuban&amp;amp;oq=Mark+Cuban&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j69i60.1918j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=119&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Mark+Cuban+Trump+vice+president"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
				vice president, Cuban could be in charge of driving entrepreneurship
				and technology. With those domains as his portfolio, Cuban could be
				the most impactful VP of all time. That is hard to
				resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real benefit of a Cuban vice
				presidency is that you would trust him to turn on Trump &amp;ndash;
				and publicly &amp;ndash; if Trump became truly evil. No worn-out
				Republican governor would turn on a sitting president in his own
				party. That isn’t a real option. If you want to solve for Trump’s
				scariness, you want a strong, independent voice on the inside. You
				need someone who is NOT a career politician. You need someone to
				disagree with Trump when it matters. (Cuban and Trump disagree on
				the issue of Apple unlocking the iPhone encryption, for
				example.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine Trump as president with a weak
				VP. That might feel scary to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine
				Trump with an outspoken and pragmatic Mark Cuban as VP. And imagine
				too that Cuban is willing to resign as VP the minute Trump shows any
				signs of turning into an evil dictator. That would be an effective
				control on Trump. And probably one he doesn’t
				relish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it solves for scary. So look for Mark
				Cuban to be on Trump’s short list. And look for Trump to find an
				experienced politician (a John Kasich type) as his chief of staff.
				That’s all Trump needs to navigate Washington DC. Presidents have
				plenty of advisors on call. But there are not many Mark
				Cubans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we have Trump and Cuban as a
				team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a related and positive note, I think we
				should all be delighted at the richness of choice in this election.
				This is something special. I have never been more optimistic for the
				country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I might be on
				CNN today (Monday, Feb 22nd) at around 4:45 EST, talking about
				Trump, but these things can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img

			<title>The Pope Versus Donald Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Pope Francis &lt;a
				href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-pope-francis-isis-vatican-2016-2"&gt;questioned
				Donald Trump’s faith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more
				--&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your firewall is being a bad Christian and
				blocking the image below, try this bridge to &lt;a
				href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/700515843801657344"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

				alt="image" data-orig-width="2708"
				data-orig-height="1200"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could write a
				long essay about this Pope versus Trump situation, but I think it
				will be funnier to summarize it instead. What follows is &amp;ndash;
				as far as I can tell &amp;ndash; an accurate description of what
				happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The Pope criticized
				Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The Pope’s credibility
				declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this were fiction,
				no one would believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I predict that the Pope
				will issue a public apology to Trump for questioning his faith, as
				opposed to his policies. [Update: And &lt;a
				href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-trump-spokesman-idUSMTZSAPEC2JSUF1DQ"&gt;here

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Readers of this blog have been asking me to
				compile my Trump posts in a convenient index so you can direct

				go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fun of it is seeing how early I predicted
				Trump’s rise (8/13/15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more

			<title>Drone Risks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now hobby-sized drones can fly for up to two
				hours on solid fuel pellets. Read about it &lt;a
				href="http://scottadams-tttt.tumblr.com/post/139143451756/top-tech-204-largest-aircraft-widest-glider"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
				This technology isn’t yet commercial, but it probably will be in
				several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how far a hobby-sized
				drone can fly in two hours. And I don’t know how hard it would be to
				program one to fly from wherever you are to a specific GPS location.
				But when those two technologies come together, how do you stop a
				weaponized suicide drone from attacking literally anywhere on
				Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img
