				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia’s president and Prosecutor General have offered a stick and carrot approach to dealing with NGOs that the government views as pesky at a recent gathering of the nation’s prosecutors.</p>
<p>Top Prosecutor Yury Chaika called on his colleagues at a March 23 gathering “to take exhaustive response measures” against NGOs that are “violating laws,” and said this should go as far as seeking “their dissolution via court proceedings,” in remarks carried by the <a href="http://tass.ru/politika/2881994">TASS</a> official newswire.</p>
<p>This appears to reinforce a policy recently adopted by the Ministry of Justice that targets so-called “foreign agent” NGOs <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-02-russias-justice-ministry-resorts-to-suing-ngos-into-closure">and sues them out of existence</a>.</p>
<p>He further urged the gathering to tighten controls on law enforcement agencies and governmental regulatory bodies enforcing <a href="http://bellona.org/work-areas/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law">Russia’s NGO law</a>.</p>
<p>Chaika said that a <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2013-04-russian-ngos-undergoing-unprecedented-kremlin-sweeps">major prosecutorial sweep of NGOs in 2013 and 2014</a> “revealed numerous violations of the law due to lack of control and unwillingness [of NGOs] to work transparently,” adding that, “these violations should now be at the center of your attention.”</p>

	</p>

<p>That was the stick.</p>
<p>But speaking earlier at the at the same gathering, President Vladimir Putin dangled the juicy possibility of granting special benefits to NGOs that are “irreproachable partners of the state,” according to remarks carried by <a href="http://ria.ru/economy/20160323/1395465790.html">RIA Novosti</a>.</p>
<p>He added that a bill underpinning this would be initiated in the Russian Parliament.</p>
<p>What still remains unclear is how these two groups would be divided.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2012-07-breaking-russian-duma-passes-controversial-ngo-foreign-agent-bill-in-landslide-vote">2012 law on NGOs</a> says that non-profits receiving foreign funding and engaging in “political activity” must declare themselves as foreign agents with the Justice Ministry.</p>
<p>In 2014 the Justice Ministry was <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2014-06-new-law-allowing-russia-justice-ministry-name-foreign-agents-claims-five-ngos">granted powers to force NGOs</a> onto the <a href="http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx">list of foreign agents</a> at its own discretion.</p>
<p>The effect has been that <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-10-foreign-agent-law-has-put-33-percent-of-russias-ngos-out-of-business">about a third of Russia’s NGOs</a> have had to shutter their doors for good.</p>
<p>The sticky point for everyone has been exactly what the law’s definition of “political activity” actually is.</p>
<p>The Justice Ministry in January <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-01-russian-justice-ministry-sinks-ngos-in-new-mire-of-political-activity-definitions">published proposed amendments</a> that would define political activity that the NGO sector said made the term even more impossibly broad.</p>
<p>The Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society loudly challenged the amendments, and <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-03-russian-legislators-and-human-rights-officials-come-out-swinging-over-ngo-law-amendments">they remain deadlocked in the floor of parliament</a>.</p>
<p>While the fate of the amendments remains unclear, legal experts and NGO leaders are unimpressed with the palliative notion that there are benefits to being the government’s “irreproachable” allies.</p>
<p>Artyom Alexeyev, director of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona, and a lawyer, said Chaika’s punitive remarks were aimed at those NGOs that work with human rights and environmental issues.</p>
<p>“Correspondingly […] they apparently plan to reward obedient NGOs, the tame ones, who conscientiously fulfill government contracts for implementing social programs,” he said by email.</p>
<p>“It’s well known that many such organizations are ‘bought’ and are mostly aimed at receiving state funding, and not at providing any real help,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Andrei Zolotkov, former director of Bellona Murmansk, wh<a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-03-bellona-murmansk-listed-russian-justic-ministry-foreign-agent">ich made it to the foreign agent list</a> and <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-10-two-decades-of-legal-harassment-dissolve-bellona-murmansk-as-a-russian-ngo-but-it-will-continue-its-work">subsequently disbanded as an NGO in 2015</a>, agreed.</p>
<p>“So, they’ve gone and divided NGOs into good and bad, that is foreign agents, and will further pontificate about how possible offenders will be punished and chastised,” Zolotkov said by email.</p>
<p>“All of these announcements from high podiums don’t contribute anything good to the public mood,” he added.</p>
<p>Russia’s Justice Ministry currently lists <a href="http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx">124</a> foreign agents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MURMANSK – Despite the fact that the Kola nuclear power plant produces 500 megawatts of unneeded energy per year, Russia’s nuclear utility Rosenergoatom is holding a tender for upgrades to the station’s No 1 reactor &#8212; with the aim of running it for 60 years.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://zakupki.rosatom.ru/1603141065058">Goczakupok</a>, the state’s official site for open tenders, Rosenergoatom is billing the work for nearly 700 million rubles ($10.3 million) and the upgrades are to take place between June 1, 2016 and October 1, 2018. Candidates for the project, says the site, are being accepted until April 4 and the winner will be announced by May 4.</p>
<p>Vasily Omelchuk, the plant’s director, says that the foreseeable future holds no possibilities for other energy development, be it in the form of new hydroelectric stations, renewable sources or even the construction of a second Kola nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>“Therefore the engineered lifespans of reactors No 1 and 2 were extended by 15 years to 2018 and 2019,” said Omelchuk. “The station has worked out an investment plan to extend the lifespan of it reactors generally to 60 years, or for 15 years a piece,” he told an ecological gathering of the Murmansk Regional Government and the Public Council on Atomic Energy.</p>

	</p>

<p>The station’s reactor No 1 this year reached 43 years old. All four of the plants reactors are working on extended engineering lifespans, and each was initially designed expected to run for 30 years.</p>
<p>“When making important decisions in Russia’s nuclear industry, they look at the economics first and foremost,” said Alexander Nikitin, chairman of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona. “Other questions like safety come later.”</p>
<p>Nikitin said the nuclear industry had tallied up the cost of building a new €5 billion reactor against the cost of a €10 million extension and opted for the later. He added that reactor decommissioning costs would run another €1 billion</p>
<p>“So having invested €10 million or even €20 million into lifespan extensions, this one will run until 2030,” Nikitin said.</p>
<p>Nikitin said the station’s management is not so concerned with safety because of simple logic. In Russia’s financial crisis €5 billion for a new reactor in the Murmansk Region – which already has more energy than it needs – is hard to come by.</p>
<p>“As far as safety issues, apparently they’ll solve them as they come up,” said Nikitin. “The most important thing is to establish monitoring and timely response to any problems that may arise at the reactor.”</p>
<p>That the population of the Murmansk Region  has been convinced that extending the run-time of the station’s oldest reactor makes it safer is suggested by something else: Rosatom’s website for state tenders has received bids to advertise for the Kola plant amounting to <a href="http://zakupki.rosatom.ru/1603140513440">1 million rubles (€13,200) from one regional broadcaster</a> and <a href="http://zakupki.rosatom.ru/1603140513439">nearly a million and a half (€20,000) from another</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned with the fact that the oldest reactor at the station is getting prolonged again,” said Nils Bøhmer, Bellona’s executive director and nuclear physicist. “It’s outdate technology, a very old reactor and I’m afraid that the decision will significantly increase risks of an incident.”</p>
<p>This year, public hearings will take place <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2016-02-another-reactor-at-russias-kola-nuclear-plant-gets-a-run-time-extension">to determine whether Kola’s No 3 reactor can be run at above nominal power levels of up to 107 percent</a>. Station officials thus far haven’t offered an articulate answer as to why this is necessary.</p>
<p>The station earlier, in 2012, received permission to run its No 4 reactor at 104 to 107 percent nominal, which, between 2012 and 2015 it did for 93 days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MURMANSK – Despite vociferous environmental protest and safety concerns, Norway’s <em>Goliat</em> oil platform, the world’s northernmost rig, has gone into service in the Barents Sea, drawing fire from Bellona over Norway’s zero emissions promise and safety demands for the project.</p>
<p>But, at the moment, the oil companies couldn’t appear to be more psyched, despite these concerns.</p>
<p>The 65,000-ton <em>Goliat</em> platform, a floating rig, is the first attempt to produce oil from the Norwegian portion of the Arctic Ocean’s shelf where the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea meet.</p>
<p>Hauled nearly 25,000 kilometers from a South Korean shipyard aback the <em><a href="http://www.dockwise.com/page/fleet/vanguard.html">Dockwise Vanguard</a></em> the floating rig is a spearhead effort between the Italian oil giant Eni, and Norway’s state oil concern Statoil to bore into assumed Arctic hydrocarbon riches. Eni owns a 65 percent stake in the operation, and Statoil 35 percent.</p>
<p>By most accounts, everything about the <em>Goliat</em> platform is, as its name suggests, huge, reports <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/energy/2015/04/150423-arctic-oil-rig-goliat-eni-statoil-norway-global-warming/">National Geographic</a> indicate. At 175 meters, reports the magazine, the <em>Goliat</em> is 16 stories taller than Norway’s highest skyscraper, Trondheim’s <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190499-d318980-r138079637-Tyholttarnet-Trondheim_Trondheim_Municipality_Sor_Trondelag_Central_Norway.html">Tyholttårnet broadcasting tower</a>, measuring in at 124 meters. That’s bloody tall. And <em>Goliat’s</em> mooring lines, says the same report, are more than a meter thick.</p>
<p>Its accommodations on the <em>Goliat</em> aren’t shabby either: With a 17-story elevator for service crew, it can comfort 120 beleaguered worker, who can take their downtime in a movie theater, health club and Italian designed kitchen and cafeteria while 9-meter waves and paving winds lash the rig in polar darkness, noted National Geographic.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty lush, were it not for major environmental concerns, and the fact that the rig has already broken a number of conditions laid out for it by the Norwegian government.</p>
<p>Bellona President Frederic Hauge’s concerns lay with the practices and professionalism of <a href="http://www.eninorge.com/en/field-development/goliat/facts/">Eni Norway</a>, the project’s chief operator.</p>
<p>“The main promise for operating the <em>Goliat</em> platform in the Arctic was that it would produce zero emissions,” said Hauge. “But that promise seems to have gone by the wayside right out of the gate – everything has gone out of control and Eni is not able to uphold that promise.”</p>
<p><em>Goliat’s</em> first difficulty is leaks of fire retardant foam, which contains so called “black chemicals” which effused during the test stages of the platform. Such leaks occurred numerous times, spilling some 800 kilograms of perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, which contain a blend of fluourocarbons, and are known to be harful to the climate, said Hauge.</p>

	</p>

<p>“This is a direct violation of the ‘zero emissions’ terms, which were the most important conditon of the project as established by Norwegian Parliament,” said Hauge. “In early March, Bellona filed an official police report, and I am ineffably surprised, even shocked, that the authorities have up to now not initiated an investigation.”</p>
<p>Karl Kristensen, Bellona’s advisor on industrial waste, said the environmental group is deeply concerned about the numerous violations of Norwegian safety requirements by Eni as well as its flaunting of direct instructions from the Norway’s oil and gas safety oversight body, the <a href="http://www.psa.no/?lang=en_US">Petroleum Safety Authority</a>, on how the violations should be addressed.</p>
<p>“We believe this shows a critical lack of willingness or capability by Eni Norge to comply with the safety standards demanded by the Norwegian government,” said Kristensen.</p>
<p>“For this reason Bellona questions whether Eni Norge should be allowed to continue as operator of the <em>Goliat</em> field, or on the Norwegian continental shelf at all,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Goliath</em> platform’s checkered past </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Goliath</em> platform is the second offshore drilling project in the European portion of the Arctic.</p>
<p>The first was the Russia State Corporation Gazprom’s storied <a href="http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/oil/2014-04-russia-opens-oil-sluices-arctic-rickety-prirazlomnaya-platform-begins-production">Prirazlomnoye platform</a> and field in the Pechora Sea, which in 2014 opened production with 70,000 tons of substandard, low cost crude blend called ARCO.</p>
<p>But at latitude of 71.3 north, said National Geographic, the <em>Goliat</em> is 225 kilometers closer to the North Pole than the Prirazlomnoye.</p>
<p>Still, the Prirazlomnoye drew the first vial of black blood in environmental conditions that years of studies and analyses have concluded is far from fit for industrial oil operations.</p>
<p>The customer of the Prirazlomnoye’s ARCO crude was France’s Total, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/oil/2012-09-frances-total-swears-off-artic-oil-drilling-putting-other-majors-in-environmental-hot-seat">which in 2012 had sworn off its own Arctic development plans</a>, but was apparently happy to buy Arctic crude produced by others.</p>
<p>There were also numerous construction problems with the Prirazlomnoye platform – which is largely cobbled together from old, failed Norwegian rigs – and a consensus of opinion that any spills that might result from its operation would be impossible to deal with because of Russia’s lack of Arctic oil spill containment infrastructure.</p>
<p class="image  align-right">

	</p>

<p>“There is a more than a likely chance of an oil spill resulting from the operation of the Prirazlomnoye platform,” Viktor Petrov, head of the Kola Center for the Defense of Wildlife told Bellona in an interview in 2014. “Even in the event of a medium size spill, oil would coat the entire aquatic area of the Pechora Sea, and in Arctic conditions, oil products will continue to be present for hundreds of years.”</p>
<p>The construction of the <em>Goliath</em> in South Korea was no breeze for Eni either, <a href="http://thebarentsobserver.com/industry/2016/03/first-barents-oil-production-has-started">The Independent Barents Observer</a> news portal reported. The many delays in finishing it, said the portal, drove the platform’s price up from €1.8 billion to €5 billion.</p>
<p>The beginning of drilling was likewise planned for 2013, but that was put off by Norway’s Petroleum Safety Authority until January 2016.</p>
<p>The Goliat field was discovered 16 years ago, and it’s estimated production by the end of the year will be some 100,000 barrels per day, reported the Independent Barents Observer, adding oil will be stored in the floater itself before being reloaded to tankers and sailed to the markets. It will process this oil from its 11 subsea production wells.</p>
<p>The project is expected to be profitable, according to Russian and Norwegian experts, once oil hits $95 a barrel. According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/energy">Bloomberg Business</a>, Brent crude was trading on Tuesday for $38.91 per barrel and US WTI at $36.38. Oil prices are expected to remain in this lull for the remainder of the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of March 11, 2011, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake in the Pacific sent a massive wall of water rolling towards Japan’s Northeast coastline and the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The reactors at the plant shut down automatically moments after the quake at sea. But 41 minutes later the tsunami it generated burst through the plant’s defenses – including a sea wall that was too low – and inundated the reactor buildings.</p>
<p>Water flooded emergency generators leaving the plant without power for cooling systems. With no cooling, radioactive decay continued to heat the reactor cores. In the control room, workers struggled to run crucial instruments, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2011-06-tepco-report-reveals-chaos-and-lack-of-preparedness-in-the-hours-following-tsunami-at-fukushima-daiichi">using flashlights and car batteries scavenged from nearby vehicles and to search for emergency procedure manuals</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next three days, the last line of emergency systems failed.

As a result, highly contaminated water flowed directly into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>In the coming days, Japan shut down its 42 remaining nuclear reactors and 160,000 people were forced to evacuate homes that housed generations of their families in agricultural Fukushima, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-03-displaced-fukushima-survivors-come-to-terms-with-never-going-home-again">some never to return</a>.</p>
<p>This was the opening chapter of the worst nuclear power nightmare since Chernobyl in 1986.</p>
<p>Five years later, gaping questions about the plant’s condition remain. Reactors are too dangerous for humans to enter. The plant&#8217;s owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co, or Tepco, remains tight lipped with information, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/crippled-fukushima-reactors-are-still-a-danger-5-years-after-the-accident1/">according to Scientific American</a>, and at the plant alone, it&#8217;s estimated to take another 50 years remain before clean up is complete. Its reactors will never work again.</p>
<p><strong>The rush to restart reactors</strong></p>
<p>Now, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed against public jitters to restart <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-10-second-reactor-in-post-fukushima-japan-goes-online-to-muted-local-protests">two reactors at the Sendai</a> nuclear power plant last year. Two others that were restarted this year at the Takahama plant and <a target="_blank" href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20160309_25/">were again shutdown by a court injunction</a> filed by a nervous local populace. Up to 70 percent of the public is worried about Fukushima Act II and oppose the restarts, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/20/despite-meltdowns-a-tsunami-and-public-opposition-japan-may-soon-restart-a-nuclear-power-plant-or-several/">The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Hiccups plaguing the restarts justify those fears and suggest the government might be rushing things: Takahama’s most recent restart was a failure. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/01/national/science-health/japan-hit-hasty-bid-restart-reactors-problems-safety-fears-surge/#.Vt9BaSk7R_z">It went back online on Feb 29 only to be switched off again by an emergency shutdown on March 4</a>. The incident was blamed on an abnormally strong electric current. The reactor also leaked 34 liters of radioactive water from a cooling system. The <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2015-08-japan-restarts-first-reactor-since-fukushima-disaster-amid-protest-and-concerns-over-new-regulator">Sendai No 1 reactor</a> had a problem with equipment that caused a seawater leak from a cooling system before it was shifted to commercial operation mode.</p>

<p>This can’t inspire much confidence in Japan&#8217;s  <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-03-new-japanese-nuclear-regulatory-agency-must-assert-its-opinion-as-confusion-around-fukushima-disaster-still-lingers-2">Nuclear Regulatory Authority</a>, a newly-minted post-Fukushima body that developed Japan’s <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2014-03-working-document-bellonas-analysis-post-fukushima-stress-tests-russian-nuclear-power-plants">stringent regimen of stress tests and upgrades</a> that another 21 reactors must pass before they’re allowed to operate. Several of Japan’s oldest reactors, said the regulator, will be decommissioned. Still, the agency is <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-07-post-fukushima-nuclear-regulator-overwhelmed-as-power-companies-jockey-to-turn-on-the-atomic-juice">overwhelmed with restart applications</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2014-09-japans-regulator-approves-reactor-restarts-pending-public-approval-far-will-industry-go-buy-smiles">industry wants its rubber stamp</a>.</p>
<p>Further fueling suspicions that government and industry are soft-pedaling the catastrophe was its announcement in February that it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35650625"> delayed reporting</a> meltdowns at Fukushima by two months – possibly hindering wider evacuations and endangering lives, noted Scientific American and others.</p>
<p>That the Japanese public <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-03-tokyo-demonstrates-in-force-against-nuclear-power-on-eve-of-fukushimas-second-anniversary">isn’t taking to the streets the way they did as recently as 2013</a> doesn’t mean <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2014-03-three-years-fukushima-japanese-anti-nuke-sentiment-strong-fading-street">public trust – and wounds in the Japanese psyche and environment – have started to heal</a>, said Hideyuki Ban, co-director of the Tokyo-based Citizens’ Nuclear Information Center.</p>
<p>“Dealing with these extreme uncertainties is part of living in a society where the support for nuclear power is expected, even when it goes against common sense,&#8221; he told Bellona by email.</p>
<p>One anecdotal piece of evidence that the government is still cooking data, said Ban, is reports he’s received from independent scientists. Many, he says, suspect authorities are discouraging certain kinds of scientific research for fear the findings could further alarm a beleaguered public.</p>
<p>“They want this to go away and say things are back to normal,” wrote Ban.</p>

<p><strong>Reluctant repatriation to excessive exposure levels </strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile tens or thousands of people are still waiting to return to their homes near Fukushima Daiichi after fleeing them five years ago in terror – and not all are happy to go back.</p>
<p>Last year the Japanese government announced <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2014-04-first-trickle-fukushima-evacuees-allowed-back-home-amid-persistently-high-radiation-levels">it would eventually lift evacuation orders for regions where a person would receive an annual radiation dose of 20 millisieverts or less</a> – the dosage level the Japanese government declared safe for its nuclear workers in the heat of the crisis.</p>
<p>To compare Fukushima repatriation to its older brother Chernobyl, even the Soviet Republic of Ukrainian set safe exposure levels for returning to areas around the exploded plant at 1 millisievert per year. From a government <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2012-08-russia-announces-enormous-finds-of-radioactive-waste-and-nuclear-reactors-in-arctic-seas">that thought nothing of chucking entire nuclear subs at sea</a>, such stringent exposure requirements leave the only country ever hit by a nuclear bomb looking a bit shame-faced.</p>

<p>“There has been no education regarding radiation,” Katsunobu Sakurai, the mayor of Minamisoma, recently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/five-years-after-meltdown-it-safe-live-near-fukushima">told Science magazine</a>. Some 14,000 people were evacuated from his area after the accident.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult for many people to make the decision to return without knowing what these radiation levels mean and what is safe,” he said.</p>
<p>Tepco is driving repatriation by vowing to cut off compensation to 32,000 Fukushima refugees, Scientific American reported, effectively blackmailing them into accepting unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>“There are several tens of thousands who were relocated because of radioactive contamination in areas surrounding the plant,” said Nils Bøhmer, Bellona executive director and nuclear physicist, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-03-analysis-fukushima-two-years-later">who with other Bellona staff has visited Fukushima</a>. “Most likely most of the will remain exiled from their homes for the rest of their lives.”</p>
<p><strong>Mortal battles over forecasted mortality rates</strong></p>
<p>What effects the disaster will have on the future health of those exposed is unclear.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/-2015-.html">Scientific American cited a 2015 World Nuclear Industry Status Report that attributed</a> 3,200 deaths to Fukushima, caused by a variety of ailments, suicides and trauma arising from the evacuation. The magazine also cited a 2013 study published in <a target="_blank" href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/EE/c2ee24183h#!divAbstract"><em>Energy and Environmental Science</em></a> that estimated roughly 1,000 future cancer deaths would come of exposure to radioactive cesium, which is too little to be attributed to other factors.</p>

<p>Yet another earlier report from 2011, leaked to Bellona by Japan’s now-defunct watchdog, the Nuclear Safety Commission, indicated those figures fell short. <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2011-08-half-of-fukushima-children-exposed-to-radiation-say-leaked-data-but-is-even-that-too-low">The report said that half the children evacuated from the Fukushima area showed traces of radioactivity absorbed by their systems</a>, which could result in future cancers. The report was stripped from a government website only hours after it was posted, citing patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>But last year, an ultrasound screening project was conducted on 300,476 people who were under 18 at the time the Fukushima disaster occurred.. Half of the subjects examined, reported Scientific American and  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/mystery-cancers-are-cropping-children-aftermath-fukushima">Science</a> magazine, presented with solid nodules or fluid-filled cysts on their thyroids. The test further revealed 110 confirmed cases of thyroid cancer, reported Scientific American, representing, said the magazine, a 30-fold increase from the norm, allegedly caused by exposure radioactive iodine.</p>
<p>Both the <em>Energy and Environmental Science </em>study and the government thyroid screening results hover high above cancer mortality from Fukushima projected in <a target="_blank" href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf">a 2013 study by the World Health Organization</a>. Richard Wakeford of the University of Manchester, and co-author of the WHO report, told <a target="_blank" href="http://science.time.com/2013/03/01/meltdown-despite-the-fear-the-health-risks-from-the-fukushima-accident-are-minimal/">Time magazine</a> that, “The additional risk is quite small and will probably be hidden by the noise of other (cancer) risks like people’s lifestyle choices and statistical fluctuations.”</p>
<p>“It’s more important not to start smoking than having been in Fukushima,” he said.</p>
<p>Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, who co-authored the 2013 study projecting 1000 deaths told Bellona he didn’t buy the WHO’s report because its focus on the risk to each person &#8220;tends to dilute the impact&#8221; of the disaster.</p>

<p>Sussing out the extremely conservative data presented by the UN’s WHO is always complicated business. In <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/">a 2005 study</a>, the group forecasted “4000 people could eventually die of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” though said at the time only 50 deaths could be attributed to radiation exposure.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2370256/chernobyl_how_many_died.html">In 2015, the WHO sharply revised its Chernobyl death toll predictions upward by four times</a>, predicting 16,000 cases of thyroid cancer, 25,000 cases of other cancers, and an expected death toll of 16,000 taken together. Only time will tell what their final estimates on Fukushima could be.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental containment and water hazards at the plant</strong></p>
<p>For all of its documented faults, Tepco has managed from about 2013 to make a dent in cleaning up the plant, and this year opened the site to reporters somewhat more widely than previously.</p>
<p>Among the company’s credits, reported in world media, are capping shredded roofs, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2012-07-collapse-of-spent-fuel-storage-pool-at-fukushima-daiichi-could-be-worse-than-initial-accident-says-new-report">removing 1,535 fuel rods stored in the Unit 4’s spent fuel poo</a>l, and constructing ice walls to stanch the flow of groundwater that washed contaminants from the site into the ocean. These walls are like an underground picket fence around the plant, reported <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/five-years-after-meltdown-it-safe-live-near-fukushima">Science</a>,  freezing brine to –30°C with the goal of keeping groundwater out and contaminated water in.</p>

<p>Because the molten fuel in the melted down No 1 reactor still generates heat by radioactive decay, Tepco must keep pumping water through the reactor buildings and collecting as much as possible—some 400 cubic meters a day, said Scientific American, who reported  the water is stored in on-site tanks. These tanks were initially held together by rivets in the disaster’s immediate aftermath, and <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2013-04-fukushima-irradiated-water-storage-tank-springs-gaping-leak">have leaked this highly contaminated water into the sea at alarming rates</a>.</p>
<p>Tepco currently said it’s building more-secure welded tanks to hold the water, theoretically for up to 20 years. There are now about 1,000 tanks holding 750,000 tons of contaminated water, with space for 100,000 tons more. The company says it hopes to increase capacity to 950,000 tons within a year or two.</p>
<p><strong>Bagging radioactive trash – and leaving it to the elements</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s still more than 9,000,000 tons of radioactive waste stored without shelter in one-ton black bags throughout Fukushima Prefecture. The irradiated soil and brush they contain is roughly enough to fill <a target="_blank" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/22/fukushima-deep-trouble/">207 million square meter cardboard book boxes</a> that placed end to end would circumnavigate Earth, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/22/fukushima-deep-trouble/">reported Counterpunch</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.voanews.com/content/problems-keep-piling-up-in-fukushima/3194401.html">13,000,000 cubic meters</a> of this soil has yet to be collected, Scientific American, noted.  All of this will need to be stored somewhere, but where no one really knows. If they did, 800 bags of the stuff <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/japan-typhoon-etau-floods-send-hundreds-tonnes-contaminated-fukushima-water-into-ocean-1519222">wouldn’t have been carried away and deposited kilometers away by typhoon Etau last year</a>, reported Scientific American.</p>

<p><strong>Mapping the meltdown</strong></p>
<p>But none of this compares to the puzzle of trying to locate, extract and store the molten fuel that melted through the worst stricken reactors’ steel vessels, all of which remain so radioactive that human workers cannot enter them, said the magazine. According to its sources Tepco has &#8220;no idea where and how much fuel debris is in the reactor now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robots have been sent in to gain some perspective, but offered nothing conclusive, said the Magazine.  Tepco also expects robots will eventually remove the agglomerated uranium, steel and other stuff caught up in the mix by 2021, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told Scientific American.</p>
<p>A possible method of locating the fuel it is being <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/five-years-after-meltdown-it-safe-live-near-fukushima">attempted by charting muons</a> – or elementary particles similar to the electron of the melted fuel – promises a more precise picture of reactor interiors, said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/five-years-after-meltdown-it-safe-live-near-fukushima">Science magazine</a>.  But at the moment that’s guesswork and hope. Even if the lethal metallic candle wax can be extracted, there remains a critical problem of where to store this heavy-duty, high-level nuclear waste, as Japan has no storage of its own, noted Scientific American.</p>
<p><strong>Where to the costs end?</strong></p>
<p>Japan only recently recorded a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32408371">trade surplus, in 2015</a>, its first since the Fukushima crisis began. Previous that, the country had been sinking in international debt to secure liquefied natural gas, coal and oil to power it’s hobbled power sector, which depended on nuclear power for 30 percent of its electricity. The deficit was a major blow, and something the country had <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan/2012-05-japan-switching-off-its-last-operational-reactor-for-summer-in-experiment-that-may-shutter-its-nuclear-industry-for-good">not encountered for 30 years prior to Fukushima</a>.</p>
<p>But the costs and timeframes around continually combatting what Fukushima Daiichi and its twisted octopi of ruined structures are dishing out are not encouraging.</p>
<p>The projected dates for when the plant would fully be rid of nuclear fuel debris isn’t until 2020-2021, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/-2015-.html">World Nuclear Industry Status Report,</a> as cited by Scientific American <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/5-years-later-the-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-site-continues-to-spill-waste/">in another report</a>. Other discouraging figures from the Scientific American say the plant won’t be fully decommissioned until 2051 to 2061. There are no reliable estimates for how much all of that will cost, but money poured down the sluices for what’s been accomplished so far amounts to $100 billion, according to the magazine.</p>
<p>Added to that is the health cost, amounting to 3,200 deaths from ailments contracted during the evacuation and suicides, plus another conservative estimate of <a target="_blank" href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/EE/c2ee24183h#!divAbstract">1,000 possible deaths due to cancers contracted from radiation exposure</a>.</p>
<p>But the science, thanks to Tepco and Japanese government agencies, is only hardly being brought to bear. As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx">more than 437 nuclear power plants are operating worldwide</a>, many of them upon coastlines in countries with current regulations far weaker than Japan’s (see the United States and Russia), it would be naïve to not to expect another equivalent calamity, if not worse.</p>

<p>Such disasters, since nuclear power use became widespread, seem to rear their heads with every new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/cs/learning/HowLongIsGeneration">generation</a> – or even less when we account for the near meltdown at the US’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html">Three Mile Island Plant in 1979</a>.</p>
<p>“Both Fukushima and Chernobyl have shown us that the consequences of any large scale nuclear accident last for decades, if not longer,” said Bellona’s Bøhmer.</p>
<p>The Japanese method of saving face – which is writ large across the nuclear industry as a whole – is preventing the crititical information on Fukushima from being disseminated to save lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just before New Year’s the temperature at the North Pole rose to around zero degrees. This is thirty degrees warmer than normal temperatures at this time of year. According to the Norwegian Polar Institute the arctic ice has never been less widespread. Additionally, the Norwegian national broadcasting, <u>NRK.no,</u> stated that the level of sea ice measured last month was the lowest ever measured in January.</p>
<p>&#8211; <em>This frightens me. With these new observations I fear that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) might have underestimated global warming. Climate change might accelerate even faster than expected, hence the measures taken to reduce emissions are far from sufficient,</em> concludes Bellona President Frederic Hauge.</p>
<p>Hauge emphasises the fact that when many scientists have to agree on a certain issue, the conclusions might be the smallest denominator of the agreed conclusions. The consequence might therefore be that the IPCC’s conclusions are too modest and that even more stringent measures are required.</p>
<p><strong>Worries that the IPCC conclusions have been too modest </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8211; An increasing number of highly recognised climate scientists that Bellona cooperates with, are expressing the same worries. Many highly-ranked institutions conclude that there is an even more pressing need for climate action than what the IPCC has expressed,</em> argues Hauge.</p>
<p>The IPCC includes only what is scientifically proven. As there are uncertainties concerning the effects of the slow moving processes such as melting of ice, marshlands and tundra areas, these have to a small extent been considered in the Panel’s final conclusions.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; We can expect some uncomfortable adjustments in the IPCC conclusions in the upcoming years, however we must see the urgency now already. This makes me even more motivated to contribute to solving the climate problem,</em> says Hauge.</p>
<p>2015 became the warmest year ever measured. The difference from the last record measured was the longest ever. Some of it is caused by the weather phenomenon El Niño, however NASA clearly underlines that the main cause is human activity.</p>
<p>&#8211; This should worry us, adds Hauge.</p>
<p><strong>We have to go carbon-negative</strong></p>
<p>An additional concern associated with higher temperatures is that nature itself will emit larger amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>. Today a large part of the CO<sub>2</sub> is stored in the oceans, in permafrost and in vegetation. In case nature emits more CO<sub>2</sub> than it absorbs, the temperature rise can increase substantially. Hauge sees only one solution to avoid catastrophic consequences of global warming: we need to get carbon-negative solutions off the ground as fast as possible.</p>
<p><em>– </em><em>By combusting waste and biomass and then capturing and storing the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted, one would remove CO­<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This is the only solution if the global community really wants to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,</em> concludes Hauge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2015 put the transport sector in the <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2016-01-year-in-review-what-2015-has-meant-for-electro-mobility">spotlight</a>, by unmasking the commonplace nature of car makers’ fraudulent emissions testing practices and by bringing an <a href="http://newsroom.unfccc.int/lpaa/transport/the-paris-declaration-on-electro-mobility-and-climate-change-and-call-to-action/">increasing number of actors</a> in agreement over the need to transition to electric transport.</p>
<p>Thankfully 2016 looks promising for building on this momentum, with a number of upcoming opportunities to highlight and accelerate the wider uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). In the second quarter of 2016, for instance, the European Commission is expected to present a proposal for a post-2020 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), which will be accompanied by a Communication on the Decarbonisation of Transport.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 2016 will be an important year in terms of Member States’ preparatory process for the implementation of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0094">Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (AFI) Directive</a>. In fact, by November, Member States will have to have submitted their national policy frameworks, outlining how they plan to go about the directive’s transposition.</p>
<p><strong>What the AFI directive aims at</strong></p>
<p>Rendering EVs a true substitute to internal combustion engine cars depends on ensuring smooth inter-urban and international EV mobility. In countries like Norway, this has already become a <a href="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/Bellona-EV-Brief_The-Norwegian-Success-Story1.pdf">reality</a>. Thanks to a concerted effort by the government to build out a nation-wide EV infrastructure, it is now possible to drive an EV from the South of Norway to the Russian border – a distance equivalent to driving from Oslo to Rome. With the aim of establishing an interoperable EV charging infrastructure, the AFI Directive mandates the building-up of sufficient number of stations and sets EU-wide harmonised standards for charging infrastructure plugs as well as for user information requirements.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge of ensuring the right balance between standardisation and technological innovation  </strong></p>
<p>While the AFI Directive aims at taking us in the right direction, it contains ambiguous wording, which, depending on the interpretation of the Member State in mind, could result in different implementation approaches being taken. In particular, the directive does not make a clear whether the mandated charging plug standards apply to both private and publicly accessible infrastructure.</p>
<p>In other words, the vaguely worded definition of “publicly accessible” could result in the directive being interpreted to impose the same technical specifications for every new-built recharging point for EVs, irrespective of whether the infrastructure is private or publicly accessible.</p>
<p>“<em>Despite its intention to address consumer anxieties and foster EV deployment, if implemented too narrowly, the AFI Directive could act to lock us into already-outdated standards and thus unintentionally retard EV deployment</em>” comments Teodora Serafimova, Policy Adviser at Bellona Europa, in reference to the mismatch between technological innovation and standardisation processes in the EU.</p>
<p><strong>An ‘open’ approach to achieving interoperability </strong></p>
<p>Member States should aim at an open implementation of the directive. Failure to do so may result in the creation of undesirable barriers to private investors and thus act to hinder innovation and the development of more advanced and capable EV charging solutions. The need for this becomes ever more apparent given the current pace of technology development and a number of car makers already planning for the market introduction of more powerful chargers, more rapid charging, larger battery capacities and thus longer driving ranges. These technological advances are making electro-mobility more attractive and useful to European citizens.</p>
<p>Retaining this flexibility is particularly important when it comes to the build-out of fast-charging infrastructure for EVs. Fast-charging, which allows EVs to charge within minutes as opposed to hours, is crucial for rectifying the perception of EVs as constrained to the urban environment. A multi-charger solution approach to transposing the AFI directive, as observed in Norway, would make possible the co-existence of a number of different charging standards and allow for a natural market selection to take place, thereby encouraging further technological innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability goes beyond the physical charging plug</strong></p>
<p>In addition to charging plugs, Member States will have to ensure interoperability with regards to identification of charging points and payment solutions for electricity. Moreover, in order to ensure that the deployment of increasing numbers of EVs and charging points does not lead to grid disruptions, measures will need to be put in place to stimulate smart charging. Member States’ soon-to-be-submitted national plans, as part of the AFI directive’s implementation, as well as national urban mobility policies are good starting points for the inclusion of smart charging-conducive measures as well as for the clarification of the above-mentioned interpretation matters central to achieving interoperability.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian human rights officials are slugging it out on the floor of parliament with the country’s Justice Ministry over Moscow’s foreign agent law for NGOs and its definition of “political activity”– a vague charge <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-10-foreign-agent-law-has-put-33-percent-of-russias-ngos-out-of-business">that has closed down a third of Russian non-profits</a> since the law was adopted.</p>
<p>Human rights experts across the board have told Bellona that should the amendments pass, there’s little hope non-profits in Russia will continue to exist at all.</p>
<p>The amendments, opposed by human rights circles, could soon be adopted as law when reviewed by both parliamentarians in the Duma and the Federation Council, its upper body, Justice Minister Alexei Konovalov said yesterday, according to the official <a href="http://ria.ru/politics/20160302/1382930088.html">RIA Novosti</a> Russian newswire.</p>
<p>Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society, has meanwhile mounted a vociferous political and media campaign to divert the Justice Ministry’s suggested definitions of “political activity” from being adopted.</p>
<p class="image  align-left">

<p>At the end of January, the Justice Ministry – as directed by President Vladimir Putin – <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-01-russian-justice-ministry-sinks-ngos-in-new-mire-of-political-activity-definitions">published proposed amendments</a> that would define political activity that lawyers and activists, among them Fedotov and Russia’s Human Rights Ombudsman Ella Pamfilova, agreed threw definition even further off course and even more subject to selective and arbitrary interpretation.</p>
<p>Even with some editing, though, the law as it currently stands is so amok that one environmental NGO leader, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-03-russian-environmental-ngo-sues-state-tv-for-accusing-it-of-espionage">Nadezha Kutepova, had to flee Russia for fear she’d be locked up for espionage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>‘Latex’ amendments stretch too far</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.otr-online.ru/programmi/novosti-otrazhenie-nedeli-31470/pravozaschitniki-i-obschestvennie-50894.html">Russian television interview earlier</a> this week, Fedotov said that the Justice Department’s broad definition of political activity would make “every NGO in Russia a foreign agent.”</p>
<p>[The amendments] are of such rubber, latex I would say, formulation, they can be stretched to fit any organization, any charity fund, that you wish,” Fedotov said.</p>
<p>He added the amendments were intentionally devised as an expandable smother blanket by the Justice Ministry “probably so they could add to the number of organizations listed as foreign agents […] the revisions are so written than any organization can be considered a foreign agent because the amendments are just a rewrite of the original [2012] law.”</p>
<p>In recommendations to the Duma and the Justice Ministry last month, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-02-russias-justice-ministry-resorts-to-suing-ngos-into-closure">Fedotov told Bellona in an email interview</a> that the term “political activity” as applied to NGOs be restricted solely to “a struggle for political power.”</p>
<p><strong>The amendment package</strong></p>
<p>His suggestion, made in all seriousness, would certainly slash the fat off the amendments as they currently stand.</p>
<p>Among things that could land NGOs in official hot water for political activity in the amendments include publicly evaluating government decisions made by the government.</p>
<p>Gatherings, rallies, demonstrations, marches, pickets, public discussions and speeches are also considered political activity that would lead to an organization’s branding as a foreign agent, or closure.</p>
<p>Non-profits are also considered political if they aim to “gain a certain outcome” in elections or referendums, by monitoring elections or referendums, establish referendum or election commissions, or engage in the activities of political parties.”</p>
<p>Helping to finance an NGO would also be considered political activity.</p>

	</p>

<p>In closing, the Justice Ministry amendments state that political activity is defined as steps taken by an NGO at “shaping social and political views and opinions, including carrying out and announcing public opinion polls or other sociological research,” and involving Russian – citizens – including minors – in an their activities.</p>
<p><strong>If ‘political activity’ appeared vague before…</strong></p>
<p>Under the original law, NGOs receiving foreign funding and engaged in barely-defined “political activity” were to report themselves to the Justice Ministry as “foreign agents.”</p>
<p>For their part, non-profits demanded a clear definition of “political activity,” and <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2012-11-russian-ngos-receiving-foreign-funding-greet-new-law-to-register-as-foreign-agents-with-yawns">refused en masse to self-apply the foreign agent label</a>. Since 2014, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2014-06-new-law-allowing-russia-justice-ministry-name-foreign-agents-claims-five-ngos">Putin has allowed the Justice Ministry to declare foreign agents on its own</a>.</p>
<p>The current <a href="http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx">121 NGOs designated as foreign agents</a> have found themselves on the Justice Ministry’s list for supposed political activity, which is entirely defined by the Ministry’s regional offices, say NGO leaders and lawyers.</p>
<p>Should the amendments be adopted in their current form, suggested Alexander Nikitin, chairman of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona, said “there’s no point in trying to operated an NGO on Russian soil – its already difficult, but these amendments would be the end.”</p>
<p>Andrei Zoltkov, former director of Bellona Murmansk, agreed and said that’s the point of the current amendments.</p>
<p>“The mean only one thing,” he said in an earlier interview. “Shut up and know your place.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian environmental NGO targeted by Moscow’s foreign agent law and dogged by treason charges against its leader, is pushing a slander suit again a state broadcaster for saying it engaged in espionage, the non-profit’s former leader, Nadezhda Kutepova, told Bellona from Paris Wednesday.</p>
<p>Planet of Hopes, which sought redress for victims of radioactive contamination from Russia’s notorious <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2014-09-russia-reveals-burgeoning-amounts-damaged-spent-nuke-fuel-plans-reprocess-faltering-mayak-facility">Mayak Chemical Combine</a>, and home to the Soviet A-bomb, was accused by Rossiya-1’s government controlled news personality Olga Skabeyeva of US-sponsored corporate espionage on two of the station’s programs.</p>
<p>In both, the first of which aired on Rossiya-1’s flagship news program Vesti on May 27, and the second on June 1, during the news magazine Special Correspondent, Skabeyeva said Planet of Hopes “is engaged in corporate espionage on funding from NED [the US National Endowment for Democracy],” the <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/56d02f4d9a7947342a64210d">RBK</a> independent Russian newswire quoted court documents as saying.</p>
<p class="image  align-left">
	<a href="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2016/03/skabeyeva.jpg" title="skabeyeva">		<img src="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2016/03/skabeyeva-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="skabeyeva">

	</p>

<p>Planet of Hopes is demanding an on air retraction during both programs on which Skabeyava leveled her accusations, and renowned human rights lawyer Ivan Pavlov is seeking reimbursement of court expenses for his legal advocacy group, <a href="http://team29.org/en/about/">Team 29</a>.</p>
<p>Kutepova told Bellona she’s also filed a similar case in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> in Strasbourg, France.</p>
<p>“This is a very important case,” Kutepova told Bellona via instant messaging. “The foreign agent label automatically implies espionage.”</p>
<p>Planet of Hopes was forced on the <a href="http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx">Russian Justice Ministry’s foreign agent list</a> – of which there are currently 121 – in April 2015 for receiving a $44,188 NED grant in 2008, four years before the <a href="http://bellona.org/work-areas/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law">2012 NGO law</a> even took effect. Facing crushing organizational and personal fines, Kutepova subsequently liquidated the group.</p>
<p>Because Planet of Hopes operated in the closed nuclear city of Ozersk, Alexander Nikitin, Chairman of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona, said Kutepova was under the security services’ bell jar.</p>
<p>That made the looming allegations of espionage against the group aired by a powerful state broadcaster credible enough for 43-year-old <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-09-russian-ngo-leader-flees-to-france-amid-possible-treason-charges">Kutepova to leave Russia with her three children on Pavlov’s advice and seek asylum in Paris</a>, where they now live.</p>
<p>Later developments proved she wasn’t just being skittish.</p>
<p>A June effort in court aimed at reducing the fines Planet of Hopes was facing was scuttled by the Justice Ministry’s conclusion that the group’s activities were a threat to Russian national security, Kutepova said.</p>
<p>“This is the very definition of treason,” she said. It prompted her to write Justice Ministry prosecutors asking them to substantiate the group’s treasonous activities.</p>

<p>She said an investigation to ferret out acts of espionage came up, unsurprisingly, with enough to charge her with spying.</p>
<p>“This decision entered into force after I’d already moved to Paris,” where she received political asylum, she said. “If I’d have been in Russia, I’d have been locked up for treason.”</p>
<p>If the suit against the broadcaster and Skabeyeva is successful, Kutepova says she’s hopeful her group can resume its work shedding light on continued radioactive contamination of area residents, rivers, <a href="http://bellona.org/assets/sites/3/2015/06/fil_report_3_Eng1.pdf">lakes</a>, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2008-10-update-accident-at-mayak-leads-to-apparently-contained-radiation-leak-and-seriously-injures-one-worker">land</a> and the plight of those suffering from Mayak’s <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2008-10-chelyabinsk-region-commemorates-the-kyshtym-disaster-chernobyls-secret-older-brother">accidents</a> and <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2005-11-radiation-pollution-trial-against-mayak-plant-begins">waste dumping policies</a>, which often run afoul of Russian law. She’s also fought to have <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2007-09-chelyabinsk-region-residents-still-being-irradiated-50-years-on">residents of villages</a> bearing the brunt of Mayak’s pollution relocated.</p>
<p>But she said she won’t be moving back to Russia to join her colleagues, as the conclusion of the treason investigation still stand.</p>
<p>Instead, she says she’s in close correspondence with prosecutors in Moscow, where the slander case is being heard, helping them compile a criminal case against Skabeyava for her on-air remarks.</p>
<p>In a criminal case, were Skabeyava found to have had malicious intent based on trumped up information, she could face heavy fines and jail.</p>
<p>During several calls to the newsroom of Rossiya-1, Bellona was told Skabeyeva was unavailable for comment or not at work. Management also refused to comment on the case or the veracity of the Vesti and Special Correspondent segments.</p>
<p>Kutepova said that even just winning the current slander case would be victory enough.</p>
<p>‘This effects the whole NGO community in Russia,” she said. “If we win, the government and its engaged journalists will thing 25 times before they call anyone a spy.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The race to complete the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/arctic/russian-nuclear-icebreakers-fleet/2015-08-worlds-largest-nuclear-icebreaker-nearing-completion-in-st-petersburg">Arktika</a></em> Russian nuclear icebreaker, the first in a line of new generation vessels for use along the Northern Sea Route, has builders working in three shifts to complete the ship by May, Russian media reported.</p>
<p>But, rather than boost business along the fabled Arctic shipping lane, climate change, say experts, would actually take a bite out of far north cargo deliveries before the new icebreaker has a chance to prove its stuff.</p>
<p>The <em>Arktika</em> was due to hit the water at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg in December, but a bitter cold-snap that month, which plunged temperatures to minus 20 C, made the installation of sensitive technologies impossible, according to Russian language reports from <a target="_blank" href="http://yamal-region.tv/news/18553/">Yamal-Region TV</a> in Northwest Siberia, where the <em>Arktika</em> will do most of its work.</p>
<p>Billed by official Russian media as “the most powerful icebreaker ever built,” the <em>Arktika </em>exceeds standard dimensions, weighing in at 173 meters long, 34 meters wide, and with a water displacement of 33,540 tons.</p>
<p class="image  align-left">

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oaoosk.ru/news.html">Unified Shipbuilding Corporation</a> is building the <em>Arktika</em> on a government tender price of 85 billion rubles, or $2.3 billion in 2013, at the time the contract was inked.</p>
<p>The newer, larger <em>Arktika</em> is a prototype for two more large-scale LK-60-type icebreakers. One of them, the <em>Sibir</em>, began construction in May 2015, and is scheduled for delivery in 2019. The third is due in 2020 and both were negotiated for the same price as the <em>Arktika</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Arktika’s main business will be oil</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Arktika</em> will be delivered to the state run icebreaker port at Atomflot in Murmansk. But the vessel is built to navigate both Arctic seas and their river tributaries.</p>
<p>It will be used to assist other ships carrying hydrocarbon products from fields in the Yamal and Gydansk Peninsulas and from the Kara Sea shelf to market in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.b-port.com/news/item/159830.html">b-port.com</a>.</p>
<p>But environmentalists have questioned whether such heavy, expensive nuclear machinery like the <em>Arktika</em> and its nascent cousins are necessary at a time when cargo transports through the Northern Sea Route <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/arctic/2014-04-northern-sea-route-suez-canal-imperils-arctic">are clearly nose-diving in comparison to the Suez Canal</a>.</p>
<p>According to documents provided by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arctic-lio.com/nsr_transits">Northern Sea Route Transit Office</a>, the amount of cargo hauled along the corridor’s approximate 5,600 kilometer length reached its heyday in 2013 at 1.3 million tons – most of it minerals and hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p><strong>Northern Sea Route not hauling its weight</strong></p>
<p>But in 2014, cargo statistics dropped of a cliff to a mere 274,000 tons. The Northern Sea Route Office hasn’t yet posted any concrete figures for 2015.</p>

	</p>

<p>Russia had previously boasted the Northern Sea Route, on which the government commands a heavy toll for mandatory icebreaker accompaniment, would displace the Suez Canal as the East-West route of choice.</p>
<p>But traffic statistics from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/TRstatHistory.aspx?reportId=4">Suez Canal</a> for the same years shows it moved 754.4 million tons of cargo in 2013; 822.3 million tons in 2014, and 822.9 million tons in 2015 – and this amid the heavy risk of piracy.</p>
<p>Aleksander Olshevsky, head of the Northern Sea Route Administration, was quoted by the Russian <a target="_blank" href="%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8D%D0%B4.%D1%80%D1%84">Proved</a> website as attributing the loss in cargo tonnage along his route since 2013 to unresolved price haggling between mining operations and their customers over transport costs.</p>
<p>He also said the Russian gas condensate company Novatek switched ports from the Kola Peninsula to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>But Bellona’s Sirgurd Enge, an adviser on the Arctic and Shipping and Marine Management didn’t buy that the 80 percent drop off in cargo tonnage was due to a couple of customers sitting the shipping season out.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change and playing slalom with icebergs</strong></p>
<p>Using the Northern Sea Route shaves only about 24 percent off the distance via the Suez Canal between Rotterdam and Hong Kong – and the weather far more predictable.</p>
<p>“Climate change doesn’t mean that the Northern Sea Route is suddenly smooth sailing,” he said. “As ice caps disappear, the weather becomes more volatile and huge sections of ice are cast adrift.”</p>
<p>Such ice floes aren’t dangerous to icebreakers, said Enge, but they could turn the boats they are escorting – laden with heavy fuel and hydrocarbon products – into hundreds of little Titanics.</p>
<p>It’s come close to happening. The <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/fossil-fuels/oil/2013-09-foundering-vessel-in-arctic-finally-rescued-by-icebreakers-russian-maritime-authorities-not-pleased-by-incident">Nordvik ice-class tanker</a> in 2013 hit an ice floe north of the Taimyr Peninsula and began taking on water and threatening to spill tons of diesel fuel into the Arctic ecosystem while it foundered for a week at sea.</p>

<p>Another ice class tanker was dispatched to unload the <em>Nordvik’s</em> fuel and tow it to port under escort by the <em>Vaygach</em> and the <em>Taimyr</em> nuclear icebreakers, which after days of receiving distress calls, finally broke free of escorting a vanity mission through the Northern Sea Route by the Russian Navy’s flagship vessel.</p>
<p>That the <em>Nordvik</em> was sailing without icebreaker escort in the first place was a major violation of Northern Sea Route regulations, said Enge, and a glaring example of how poorly developed the route’s oversight and infrastructure are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Poor infrastructure means nuclear and oil spill worries</strong></p>
<p>It could be argued that the new icebreaker class will help alleviate some of these dangers by offering more escorts and by supplying rescue infrastructure to Russia’s far flung northern ports.</p>
<p>But Nils Bøhmer, Bellona’s executive director, sees two major environmental risks in that.</p>
<p>“The <em>Arktika</em> is a new nuclear vessel running the RITM-200 reactor, and if anything goes wrong with it, there’s virtually no infrastructure up there that can handle it,” he said.</p>
<p>And the vessel’s intended purpose of running oil and gas tankers in and out of the Arctic doesn’t square with international emissions slashing goals arrived at by 190 nations during the <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-12-paris-climate-deal-unites-world-in-a-common-goal-of-slashing-emissions-for-the-first-time">Paris Climate Summit</a>.</p>
<p>“Expensive deliveries of oil and gas from Russia’s far north aren’t doing the climate any good – they’re just adding to oil demands that everyone agrees must be curbed,” said Bøhmer.</p>
<p>And tapping Arctic reserves, said Enge, was nothing but expensive guesswork.</p>
<p>“It’s speculated that the Arctic holds huge hydrocarbon reserves,” he said. “But bringing Arctic hydrocarbons to market would produce some of the most expensive gasoline ever – no one would be excited about that when oil is currently cheap and plentiful anyway.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> “The EU’s targets should certainly be adjusted upwards to take the new 1.5 degree target into account,” </em>says Bellona Europa Director Jonas Helseth.</p>
<p>At the COP21 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was invited to prepare a special report by 2018 on the impacts of the 1.5°C target. In a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/climate_services/eu_begins_cop21_follow_up_040216.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none">meeting</a> with the IPCC the European Commission and scientists working on EU-funded climate research agreed to a re-orientation of on-going EU-funded projects to provide scientific results for 1.5°C impacts and pathways.</p>
<p><em>“It’s good to see a debate on implications of the 1.5 </em>°C<em> target emerging, but we have yet to see meaningful political decision that can keep Europe in the vanguard. If Europe does not adjust its targets upwards now, we are going to make it more difficult to respond in the future,</em>” Helseth commented.</p>
<p>The EU’s targets are due to be delivered by reform of the EU’s Emission Trading System and Effort Sharing Decision. Both of these, and more policies, are currently in a reform process in what the EU has dubbed the ‘year of delivery’ for climate and energy policy.</p>
<p>When asked by the press following Paris how this higher ambition will be reflected in policy, Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete passed the buck to the next Commission, saying it would be their responsibility to deal with any increased ambition, but acknowledging that “<em>with additional commitments we need additional legislation.” </em></p>
<p>Others, however, are already calling for adjustments. MEP Ian Duncan, who leads the ETS reform in the European Parliament, asked the Commission what assessment it will take on EU targets after the Paris Agreement, specifically the EU ETS. To which the Commission answered that on the basis of the Paris Agreement’s scheduled 2018 global assessment, it will have to consider whether to submit revised targets by 2023. This would be done under the review mechanism, also part of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>A joint paper prepared by the Commission Services/European External Action Service on ‘<a href="http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5853-2016-INIT/en/pdf">European climate diplomacy after COP21: Elements for continued climate diplomacy in 2016</a>’ served as a basis for the discussion of the implications of COP21 at last week’s meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. The <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/15-fac-climate-diplomacy/">conclusions</a> of this Council meeting underscore the diplomatic leadership which the EU is to continue to take globally to ensure global delivery of the Agreement’s goal. It will be up to the March Council meeting of the EU’s leaders to determine what the EU’s contributions should be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission will in 2016 present a number of legislative proposals which will set out the path for bioenergy in Europe for the next 10 years at least. The most central pieces of legislation will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>the revised or new Renewable Energy Directive for the period 2020-2030 (REDII)</li>
<li>a proposal for new bioenergy sustainability criteria</li>
<li>a reform of the Emission Trading System (ETS) to bring down emissions in power and industry</li>
<li>a reform of the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) to drive emission reductions in the sectors not covered by the ETS, namely transport, agriculture and buildings.</li>
<li>and a Communication on the Decarbonisation of Transport is also expected before the summer, which will set out the EU’s strategy to reduce emissions in transport and be followed by a legislative proposal.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of the ETS file, which is expected to continue into 2017, all of these proposals will be presented this year. The REDII and bioenergy sustainability criteria will form part of a new renewable energy package.</p>
<p>2016 is therefore clearly an important year for EU energy and climate policy. The EU’s Vice-President for the Energy Union, Maros Sefcovic, has in fact dubbed it the ‘year of delivery’ for the overarching Energy Union.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/energy-union-maros-sefcovic-year-of-delivery-2016/">Politico</a>, Vice-President Sefcovic lists the Emission Trading System, Effort Sharing Decision, COP21 follow-up, energy efficiency, electricity market design, transport and renewables as the most important pieces. And to top it off, a new governance structure to achieve the 2030 targets is also under development.</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Energy Directive II </strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month Bellona submitted a response to the European Commission’s public consultation on the REDII, which will cover the period 2020 to 2030. <a href="http://bellona.org/publication/bellona-response-to-the-consultation-on-the-preparation-of-a-new-renewable-energy-directive-for-the-period-after-2020">Bellona’s response</a> places particular focus on support scheme design for new RES development; consumer empowerment and in particular the revision of the Guarantees of Origin scheme; increasing the use of renewables in the transport sector and fostering electro-mobility; and last but not least on the benefits of and ways of fostering the uptake of third generation (marine) biofuels.</p>
<p>Regarding biofuels and the 2020 sub-target for the transport sector, Bellona sees clear room for improvement in the REDII. <strong>The ‘technology neutral’ RED sub-target for transport has been a quantity rather than quality-based policy, and therefore largely failed to incentivise the most sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. In particular, the RED has been a big driver of food-based (1<sup>st</sup> generation) biofuels which are expected to make up most of the 10% target.</strong></p>
<p>For RED II attention should be given to furthering 2<sup>nd</sup> (lignocellulosic, i.e. woody) and especially 3<sup>rd</sup> generation (marine) biofuels, the latter of which may hold the greatest potential. Bellona sees seaweed for fuel in particular as well suited to avoid the main challenges of land-based biofuels, and calls for more R&amp;D into this potential.</p>
<p>Based on lessons from current biofuels policies, we may not yet be aware of what effects policies will have and it therefore seems prudent to put in place a review of policies, for example in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Bioenergy sustainability criteria</strong></p>
<p>This review option will also be important for the new proposal on bioenergy sustainability criteria, which will also cover the period after 2020. The current biofuels and bioliquids sustainability criteria are set out in the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive and after a long process, include some provisions for recognising the harmful consequences of Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC).</p>
<p>However, a far more comprehensive look at bioenergy sustainability is now on the table, including: <em>lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy production and use; impacts on the carbon stock of forests and other ecosystems; impacts on biodiversity, soil and water, and emissions to the air; indirect land use; as well as impacts on the competition for the use of biomass between different sectors (energy, industrial uses, food).</em></p>
<p>A consultation on this is currently open and can be completed <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/consultations/preparation-sustainable-bioenergy-policy-period-after-2020">here</a> by 10 May and the Commission will also organise a stakeholder conference on 13 April.</p>
<p><strong>Emission Trading System (ETS)</strong></p>
<p>Last week the European Parliament hosted a public hearing on the ETS reform proposal where Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete answered MEPs’ questions on the Commission’s proposal. The Parliament is now set to debate the proposal for the coming year, a process to be led by MEP Ian Duncan (ECR, UK), Rapporteur on the EU ETS with the environment committee (ENVI). The topic is currently also being discussed in the Council working groups, and on 20 June the Environment Council is scheduled to discuss the ETS reform proposal.</p>
<p>See Bellona’s suggestions on integrating negative emissions in the ETS <a href="http://bellona.org/publication/bellonabrief-the-carbon-negative-solution-incentivising-bio-ccs-in-europe">here</a> and why negative emissions technologies are needed <a href="http://bellona.org/publication/bellonabrief-ipcc-5th-climate-assessment-report-an-unequivocal-call-for-action-on-bio-ccs">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Emission reductions beyond the ETS</strong></p>
<p>The Effort Sharing Decision regulates emission reductions in the on-ETS sectors, namely agriculture, housing and the biggest: transport. A revision of this policy is expected to be presented by the Commission around summer time. The proposal will guide the achievement of the 30% emission reduction target compared to 2005 in Member States and will address the bdd.integration of land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The ESD proposal will be guided by the EU’s long-term goal to become a low-carbon economy by 2050.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Italian barge and floating dock designed for Russia to further assist in transporting Soviet legacy nuclear waste to safe storage will soon be towed to the port of Murmansk, Russian news agencies have reported.</p>
<p>Though its arrival date is still unspecific, the vessel, called the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-07-russia-receiving-ship-capable-of-lifting-nuclear-waste-from-arctic-waters-from-italy">Itarus</a></em>, will be put to use shuttling reactor compartments from dismantled nuclear submarines to Russia’s northerly <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/russian-navy/2013-08-cold-war-nuclear-legacy-dismantlement-in-sayda-bay-mission-possible">Sayda Bay</a> storage site run by SevRAO, the northern branch of RosRAO, a Russian state nuclear waste handling contractor.</p>
<p>The <em>Itarus</em> has also been billed as a valuable tool <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2012-08-russia-announces-enormous-finds-of-radioactive-waste-and-nuclear-reactors-in-arctic-seas">in lifting sunken nuclear reactors, scuttled nuclear submarines, and other radioactive litter dumped by the Soviet Navy in Arctic waters over decades</a>, according to Anatoly Zakharchyov, head of Russian nuclear state corporation Rosatom’s engineering division for complex submarine dismantlement, Russian media reported.</p>
<p class="image  align-left">

	</p>

<p>Rosatom has yet to decide where this seafloor waste will be stored, though Zakharchyov has broadly hinted such undersea finds should go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2014-09-work-gremikha-naval-waste-site-continues-schedule-says-bellonas-andrei-zolotkov">Gremikha</a> naval nuclear waste storage facility.</p>
<p>The <em>Itarus</em> is capable of carrying loads of 3500 tons.</p>
<p>RosRAO said in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rosrao.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosrao/rosraosite/presscentre/enterprise_news/203027804bb74928b292bbb1133a373e">Russian release</a> Wednesday that the <em>Itarus</em> had put to water on November 15, and that final technical details are being addressed before it’s towed to Northwest Russia. The Russian crew that will staff the vessel is currently completing its training, RosRAO said.</p>
<p>Nils Bøhmer, Bellona’s executive director and nuclear physicist, said the <em>Itarus</em> “should be a good project as it will ensure safe transport of radioactive reactor compartments to storage at Sayda.”</p>
<p>“Bellona has since the early 1990&#8217;s argued for a safe dismantlement of laid-up nuclear submarines, with the storage of reactor compartments on shore,” he said. “This is what is happening now,”</p>
<p>Andrei Zolotkov, a nuclear adviser with Bellona based in Murmansk, said by email that most of this transport work has been the job of the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pallada-doc.com/en/products/95/">Pallada</a></em>, a similar floating dock type ship to the <em>Itarus</em>.</p>
<p>The drawback is that the Pallada is owned and operated by the Nerpa Naval Shipyard.</p>
<p>Zolotkov said the eventual arrival of the <em>Itarus</em> could relieve SevRAO from it’s dependence on other organizations and businesses to haul waste.</p>
<p>He was cautious, however, to agree with the assertions of Rosatom’s Zakharchyov that the <em>Itarus</em> would be doing any heavy lifting of discarded Soviet nuclear naval trash in the Kara and White Seas – which included two entire nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>“Using the <em>Itarus</em> to raise sunken [nuclear] objects – it’s not going to be able to do that independently,” of various government agencies and additional technology, Zolotkov said by email. “It could be used as a means to transport these raised objects.”</p>

	</p>

<p>Its most important contribution to retrieving the Soviet Navy’s sunken toxic treasure would be to spark more discussion about how that should be done, said Zolotkov.</p>
<p>“This is something that depends on Rosatom’s activities,” he said.</p>
<p>Zolotkov said Rosatom should finally make good on years of promises to raise the waste – and decide what equipment it would use to do so.</p>
<p>Rosatom had said several times it would embark on a plan to depopulate Arctic areas of the largely military nuclear cast offs, which includes 17,000 containers of radioactive waste; 19 ships containing radioactive waste; 14 nuclear reactors, including five that still contain spent nuclear fuel; 735 other pieces of radioactively contaminated heavy machinery, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/uncategorized/2012-09-dumped-russian-nuclear-sub-shows-no-radioactive-leaks-but-still-presents-chain-reaction-dangers-research-says">K-27 nuclear submarine</a> with its two reactors loaded with nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>Joint Russian and Norwegian expeditions to the K-27 and another sunken sub, the <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2014-09-radiological-survey-sunken-k-159-finally-puts-sea-mechanical-delays">K-159</a>, suggest neither pose imminent contamination risks.</p>
<p><a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2015-04-raising-sunken-nuclear-subs-finally-taking-center-stage">But experts on both sides agree it’s better to get them out of the water sooner than later</a>, before radioactive leakage becomes an urgent problem.</p>
<p>The Italian Government has financed the <em>Itarus</em> for an undisclosed amount. But it’s part of a donation toward <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2003-07-world-funding-pours-into-russia-for-nuclear-cleanup-and-sub-dismantling">multilateral nuclear cleanup efforts agreed to 12 years ago</a> by the Group of Eight industrialized nations, nuclear.ru said.</p>
<p>Italy has previously donated nautical nuclear cleanup ships, notably the <em><a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/uncategorized/2011-03-new-italian-nuclear-waste-ship-expected-in-murmansk-as-hopes-for-nuclear-icebreaker-fleet-melt">Rossita </a></em>, a €70 million vessel built to handle universal container transport for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste of all types, including the removable portion of nuclear reactors aboard Alpha Class Russian nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>Delivered to Russia in 2011, the <em>Rossita</em><a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/uncategorized/2013-02-italian-nuclear-waste-transport-ship-still-awaiting-work-in-northwest-russia"> saw no active duty</a> until three years after it’s arrival in Russia.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radioactive-waste-and-spent-nuclear-fuel/2014-07-multi-million-dollar-nuclear-clean-vessel-finally-sees-action-cold-war-legacy-efforts">Russia finally put it to work transporting solid radioactive waste</a> from submarines at Gremikha to storage at Sayda Bay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Barack Obama’s <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-08-should-the-new-obama-clean-power-plan-boost-expectations-for-paris">Clean Power Plan</a> – a lynchpin in <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-12-paris-climate-deal-unites-world-in-a-common-goal-of-slashing-emissions-for-the-first-time">the Paris agreement</a> reached at the city’s UN Climate Summit in December – faced conservative political blowback in the US before the negotiations even concluded.</p>
<p>But no one could have predicted that the plan’s implementation or failure could hang on the sudden death of ultra-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday, and who his replacement might be.</p>
<p>The sudden vacancy has caused confusion, but observers say it might not be a bad thing for Obama&#8217;s climate goals.</p>
<p>From an environmental view, the stakes are clear: Like no time in US history could the selection of a nominee to the high court have more influence on international climate change imperatives. Whoever ends up donning the black robe could sink or save US climate efforts and the Paris Agreement in one stroke.</p>

<p>The Clean Power Plan is the new set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations that’s the centerpiece of the Obama administration’s climate change policy.</p>
<p>It aims to guide state-level utilities away from coal-fired power generation, and toward renewable energy and natural gas, something the administration says will choke off carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030</p>
<p>It’s also a key to further US-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) development, noted Sirin Engen, a CCS adviser with Bellona.</p>
<p>“The Clean Power Plan is the main reason why the US is in the forefront of developing CCS, a technology the world desperately needs to have any hope of achieving the global agreement on climate change mitigation,” reached in Paris, she said by email.</p>
<p><strong>A good idea put on hold</strong></p>
<p>On February 9, four days before his death, Scalia was one of the 5 votes against 4 <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2016-02-us-supreme-court-jams-up-obamas-signature-climate-effort-and-imperils-ccs-development">that ruled the Clean Power Plan should neither be implemented nor enforced</a> until the high court itself heard out the Plan’s opponents.</p>
<p>Those opponents’ <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15A773-application.pdf">application for a stay</a> was filed by 29 Republican-led states and coal industry business.</p>
<p>The Court’s stay was broad: It said the Clean Power Plan could only be enforced if the Supreme Court itself ruled it could; or if the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is fast tracking the case for review in June, made its own ruling on it and the Supreme Court decided to turn away the inevitable appeal of lower court’s verdict.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, pushing through a Supreme Court nominee during this particular election year is creating a perfect storm with wildly divided Republican and Democratic points of view on the Clean Power Plan and climate change in general.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s one of those freak political weather events that have become more common with the march of global warming.</p>
<p>Talk about rising temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for optimism </strong></p>
<p>But after a few days of digesting the 24-hour din of media speculation over who could fill Scalia’s shoes and to what end, many environmentalists and lawyers are saying the Clean Power Plan has new wind in its sail thanks to the vacancy left by the 79-year-old Justice and his historical antipathy for EPA pollution regulation.</p>
<p>“After last week’s stay decision, I would have given the rule a less than 10 percent chance of surviving legal review unscathed,” Brian Potts, an environmental lawyer with Foley &amp; Lardner LLP, told <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-17/scalia-vacancy-boosts-prospects-for-obama-s-carbon-cutting-plan">Bloomberg</a>. “Now I put those odds at better than 75 percent.”</p>
<p>He’s not the only one that sees choppy waters calming.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty remarkable how the fate of the Clean Power Plan has been so topsy turvy over the past two weeks,” UCLA law professor James Salzman said, according to Bloomberg. Within a week after a Supreme Court majority indicated the challengers’ arguments had merit, “now all of the sudden there’s life.”</p>
<p>The fight over whether Obama can appoint a nominee to the Court in an election year also seems to have damped (he can – and it’s been done by 14 previous presidents).</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee, likewise, can’t just blow off reviewing an Obama nominee, as they promised on Sunday to do. But they can shoot down anyone Obama sends them, forcing the decision on a new nominee on his successor and leaving the seat empty likely for more than a year.</p>
<p class="image  align-left">
	<a href="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/Senate-Judiciary_Hearings.jpg" title="Senate Judiciary_Hearings">		<img src="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/Senate-Judiciary_Hearings-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Senate Judiciary_Hearings">
	</a>

	</p>

<p>That’s a big gamble for the anti-EPA Republicans to take, though: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, both support the Clean Power Plan, and would appoint a justice with an eye to seeing it enforced.</p>
<p>So what happens now? The general agreement so far is that three possible scenarios could prevail.</p>
<p>The first is that Obama can’t get a nominee past the Senate Judicary committee in the next 338 or so days of his office. That seems unlikely: The longest confirmation process on record was Justice Louis Brandeis at 125 days in 1916.</p>
<p>With a ruling on the Clean Power Plan from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals not due until June, any appeals on the verdict wouldn’t be heard by the Supreme Court until February or March 2017 at the earliest, or even October at the latest. That’s plenty of time to fill the vacant seat.</p>
<p>Next, even if appointing a new justice is left to the next president – Democrat or Republican – it’s worth noting that that the stay on the Clean Power Plan’s implementation wasn’t a ruling on its merits.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court ends up hearing oral arguments on appeal, things could still go favorably for the EPA even with 5 conservative Justices – if EPA pitches the case well enough that one of them breaks ranks.</p>
<p>Finally, Scalia’s seat could remain vacant. In that case, pointed out Jack Lienke, a senior attorney at the <a href="http://policyintegrity.org/">Institute for Policy Integrity</a> writing in <a href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/scalias-death-means-obamas-clean-power-plan-is-more-likely-to-succeed/">Grist</a>, a 4 to 4 split from the Supreme Court would mean the DC Circuit Court of Appeals would be upheld.</p>
<p>That decision is still a mystery but not entirely without clues. It was the Circuit Court that refused the original request to stay the Clean Power Plan’s implementation – which landed it on the Supreme Court’s desk. The Circuit Court is also staffed by three judges, two of who are democratic.</p>
<p>Even the Republican appointee has a history of rulings sympathetic to the EPA, said Ann Carlson, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law who heads the Emmett Institute on Climate Change</p>
<p>“There are no guarantees about the future of the key to developing climate technologies and phasing out coal in the US,” said Bellona’s Engen, “But with Judge Scalia’s passing, it seems that the Clean power Plan might stay in the game and, with time, deliver on its promises to significantly cut CO2 emissions.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The No 3 reactor at Russia’s Kola Nuclear Power Plant has received a renewed license to operate until December 2026, adding more time to a 5-year operational extension it was granted in 2011, worrying nuclear experts.</p>
<p>Russia’s state nuclear corporation <a href="http://www.rosatom.ru/journalist/news/697881004ba232e3b279fa8170622b38">Rosatom reported on its website</a> that the Russian Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Oversight, or Rostekhnadzor, granted the extension to the reactor – which was widely expected.</p>
<p>Its previous extension ran out on February 7, Rosatom said in its release. It added that the extended run time for Kola’s No. 3 reactor was justified by more than 100 safety upgrades it received at a price tag of 1.5 billion rubles (€16.74 million).</p>

	</p>

<p>The reactor went into service in 1981.</p>
<p>Its extension comes in the wake of <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2016-02-russias-kola-nuclear-plant-reactor-shut-down-spooks-environmentalists">a shutdown at the Kola plant’s reactor No 4 just last week</a>, which the <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2016-02-kola-nuclear-plant-shutdown-blamed-on-deteriorated-cable-ending-silence-on-the-malfunction">nuclear station said was the result</a> of “deteriorating insulation of a power cable in the course of conducting scheduled tests on an auxiliary systems pump.”</p>
<p>That reactor is currently operating on a whopping 25-year extension granted in 2014. The safety ramifications of the cable failure are under investigation, but unlikely to be disclosed to the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Extended run times could bring surprises</strong></p>
<p>The newest reactor extension at the No. 3 reactor piqued the concern of Nils Bøhmer, Bellona’s executive director and nuclear physicist.</p>
<p>“Recent development with Kola’s reactor No 4, mean we might discover a deteriorated cable or something else at reactor No 3 sooner or later as well,” he said in an interview. “The ages these reactors are reaching with their extensions can easily mean more problems will come to light.”</p>
<p>All of the Kola nuclear plant’s reactors are running on extensions granted by Rostekhnadzor with the aim of using them for as long as 60 years.</p>
<p>The plant’s No 1 and 2 VVER 440/230 type reactors went online in 1973 and 1974, respectively. Their shutdown dates are now expected in 2018 and 2019.</p>

	</p>

<p>The No 4 reactor – which, like No 4 is a VVER 440/213 model – went into service in 1984, the <a href="http://thebarentsobserver.com/industry/2016/02/extended-lifespan-kola-reactor">Independent Barents Observer</a> news portal said. It will now leave service in 2039,</p>
<p><strong>Disquieting power boosting experiments </strong></p>
<p>One caution from reactor No 4’s emergency shutdown that should be taken into account after the granting the No 3 reactor’s extension, said Bøhmer, is experimentation with boosting reactor power output.</p>
<p><a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-russia/2012-04-comment-russia-gives-up-on-boosting-chernobyl-type-reactors-but-still-eyes-vver-running-stations-for-further-experiments">Since 2012, Kola’s No 4 reactor has been the subject of an experiement</a> which periodically boosts its power output from 104 up to 107 percent its nominal capacity.</p>
<p>According to the Kola nuclear plant, reactor No 3 will also undergo such experimental power boosts as well, once a government environmental impact study for the tests is approved.</p>
<p>”It’s a flaw of the Russian system that power boosts have to clear government environmental impact studies and go through public hearings, while reactor lifespan extensions don’t,” said Bøhmer.</p>
<p>Alexander Nikitin, chairman of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona, has said running reactors above nominal power is an international practice, not just a Russian one.</p>
<p>“Difficulties can arise when a reactor is operated at any power, even at the minimum controllable level,” he said in an interview. “But the official decision to stretch the power output and all other corresponding parameters to above normal, of course, adds to risks.”</p>
<p>Boosted power regimens take place at other Russian nuclear power stations as well.</p>
<p>VVER-1000 reactors operating at Russia’s Balakovo, Kaliningrad and Rostov nuclear stations often run at 104 percent nominal output. Another reactor at the Rostov station may soon be taking part in these experiments as well, as soon as an environmental impact study is approved.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Rosatom proposed running Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors at above nominal power output as well. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, however, the plan was scrapped.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the package, Bellona President Frederic Hauge said that <em>“what the EU has presented today tells us two things: That gas will be important for a while still, but not without carbon capture and storage. Unless Norway actually builds such technology, they need to stop their gas-crusade and place not just a part, but all of their attention on alternative energy sources, for instance the interconnections to be built between Norway and the UK and Germany.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s not the first time the EU is clear on investments in gas and LNG infrastructure risking fossil lock-in, if one doesn’t plan for CCS. This is determined already in the EU’s 2050 Energy Roadmap</em>”, Hauge continued.</p>
<p><em>“When it comes to Norway, they continue talking about gas as a bridge, but it could just become a bridge to high future emissions</em>,” Hauge concluded.</p>
<p>It is therefore good to see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-49-EN-F1-1.PDF">LNG strategy</a> addressing this risk, as it reads: <em>Energy efficiency measures and lower carbon sources such as renewables are also crucial, and care should be taken with regard to investment in LNG or gas infrastructure to avoid the risk of technology lock-in or stranded assets in fossil fuel infrastructure.</em></p>
<p>The EU’s Vice-President for Energy Union Maros Sefocvic and Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete today presented the much awaited ‘energy security package’.</p>
<p>The EU’s energy security package presented in Brussels today comprises four pieces of legislation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revision of the Regulation on Security of Gas Supply which intends to improve the EU&#8217;s resilience to supply disruptions</li>
<li>Revision of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) Decision which will increase transparency and ensures that IGAs in the energy field comply with applicable EU legislation and policies</li>
<li>Strategy for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and gas storage which ensures that the EU can take full benefit of the diversification potential offered by Liquefied Natural Gas</li>
<li>Strategy for heating and cooling that aims at identifying energy saving potential in heat and cool buildings and industry</li>
</ol>
<p>With these proposals the Commission seeks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce energy security vulnerability by diversifying energy sources and increasing robustness through more energy storage capacity</li>
<li>Increase the energy efficiency of buildings so as to reduce demand for fossil fuels</li>
<li>Make it more difficult for operators to halt gas flows</li>
<li>Strengthen internal European ‘solidarity’ by ensuring that in the case of a crisis energy is prioritised where it is most needed or people are most vulnerable</li>
<li>View intergovernmental gas agreements before they’re signed and in cases where a country is particularly vulnerable to one supplier, get access to contracts so as to ensure one country’s short-term interests to not contradict the strategic interests of Europe as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>The EU’s Climate and Energy Commissioner, Arias Cañete said in a speech last week that <em>“It is no coincidence that we launch the Energy Security Package at this time. The developments in the international energy context and the post-Paris scenario are posing new challenges that need to be addressed without delay.”</em></p>
<p>Today the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes and some countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, depend for their gas imports on one main supplier &#8211; Russia. Diversification of energy sources has therefore been a central driver of both the European Energy Security Strategy and the overarching Energy Union initiative.</p>
<p>Climate change has been the other driver. With the EU’s 2030 targets of at least 40% greenhouse gas emission reductions, at least 27 % renewable energy and at least 27 % energy efficiency, the package presented today, particularly regarding heating and cooling, is a step on the way to a low-carbon economy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia’s Justice Ministry has deployed another tactic to shut down NGOs it says aren’t in compliance with the foreign agent law: suing them in court and demanding their liquidation, opening a new front against Russia’s embattled non-profits, legal experts said Monday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Russian daily <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2016/02/11/628497-minyust-zakril-agoru">Vedomosti</a> reported that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan had upheld Justice Ministry requests to close Agora, a human rights and legal assistance organization that operates in 41 Russian regions.</p>
<p>According to Agora’s former chairman, Pavel Chikov, Agora is the first Russian NGO to be torpedoed by a lawsuit.</p>
<p>“Important! The Supreme Court of Tatarstan just liquidated Agora on the basis of a lawsuit from the Ministry of Justice,” he wrote in Russian late last week <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/pchikov/status/697363121229402112">Twitter</a>. “It’s the first liquidation decided by a court – we are very proud.”</p>
<p class="image  align-left">

	</p>

<p>He added that the group plans to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Ella Pamfilova, Russia’s human rights ombudsman, said that should the Justice Ministry’s continue to exploit its new strategy, then Russia would soon have no more human rights organizations, Russian media reported.</p>
<p>But about 24 hours after the Agora verdict was publicized, Russian media reported the Justice Ministry had filed suit in a Moscow for closure – this one  against Golos, the independent election monitoring NGO.</p>
<p>In both cases, Russian analysts have said the organizations were targeted for nickel and dime violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2012-07-breaking-russian-duma-passes-controversial-ngo-foreign-agent-bill-in-landslide-vote">2012 Law on NGOs</a> gathered during unannounced sweeps by law enforcement.</p>
<p>For liquidation proceedings to be justified, Russia’s Constitutional Court determined last year that the Justice Department must prove a pattern of significant and repeated breaches of the law.</p>
<p>But Artem Alexeyev, director of the Environmental Rights Center (ERC) Bellona and a lawyer with the anti-corruption group Transparency International said the Agora and Golos suits seemed to lower the bar on the Constitutional Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>“We can say that the Justice Ministry bringing suits for liquidation of human rights NGOs is a new step in the battle against [Russia’s] third sector,” he said in an email interview.</p>
<p>Anita Sobolyov, a member of the Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society agreed, saying offenses like anti-state or extremist activities would typically be considered grounds for liquidation.</p>
<p>She said the offenses compiled against Agora and Golos “could easily have been addressed and corrected.”</p>
<p><strong>Liquidation for minor errors</strong></p>

	</p>

<p>The original 2012 NGO law stipulated that non-profits in Russia receiving foreign financing and undefined &#8220;political activity” must register with the Justice Ministry as foreign agents. <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2012-11-russian-ngos-receiving-foreign-funding-greet-new-law-to-register-as-foreign-agents-with-yawns">This order was universally boycotted</a>. In June 2014, President Vladimir Putin <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2014-06-new-law-allowing-russia-justice-ministry-name-foreign-agents-claims-five-ngos">granted the Justice Ministry to name foreign agents on its own</a>.</p>
<p>The foreign agent list now contains 114 NGOs, and the number of Russian non-profits <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2015-10-foreign-agent-law-has-put-33-percent-of-russias-ngos-out-of-business">has decreased by over a third since the law took effect four years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Bellona’s Alexeyev said it’s possible that “suits for liquidation for minor infractions will be applied not only to NGOs on the [Justice Ministry’s] list of foreign agents, but other NGOs for minor violations, like failing to deliver reports, or for violations of labor, sanitary or fire codes – I hope it doesn’t come to that.”</p>
<p>Golos and Agora – which were both forced onto the foreign agent list last year – seem to be a case in point.</p>
<p>In its suit against Golos, the Justice Ministry said the organization failed to provide documents for review on time, and more specifically that it failed to provide a change of address to authorities in time after the organization moved, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2016/02/11/628536-minyust-likvidirovat-golos">Vedomosti</a> reported.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can go down for &#8216;political activity&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>In Agora’s case, said the paper, the Justice Ministry’s suit alleged that numerous violations emerged during a September inspection. Among them: conducting public meetings at inappropriate intervals, and posting its financial records – as required by law – on the internet without specifying they&#8217;d been compiled by was a “foreign agent.”</p>
<p>The group also was accused of conducting “political activity,” a term in the NGO <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-02-putins-human-rights-council-says-justice-ministry-botched-ngo-law-amendments">law the Justice Ministry has recently tried – and failed – to clarify with a series of amendments</a>.</p>
<p>Agora’s act of political activity was specified in the court documents as “purposefully form[ing] public opinion,” reported Vedomosti, quoting from the Justice Ministry’s suit.</p>

<p>Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights and Civil Society, said earlier this month that <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-01-russian-justice-ministry-sinks-ngos-in-new-mire-of-political-activity-definitions">the Justice Ministry’s proposed amendments</a> to the NGO law “make it such that any activity can be called political.”</p>
<p>The Council on Thursday filed a proposal suggesting that the term “political activity” as applied to NGOs be restricted solely to &#8220;a struggle for political power.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Waiting for other shoes to drop</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, other Russian NGOs are bracing for the fallout out of the Justice Ministry’s new bent for lawsuits.</p>
<p>Vladimir Slivyak, co-chair of Ecodefense, one of Russia’s oldest ecological and anti-nuclear groups and a Justice Ministry-designated foreign agent, said in an interview that he expected to feel the brunt of the new tactic.</p>
<p>His group was forced onto the foreign agent list in June 2014 when the Justice Ministry determined that its protests against <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-russia/2013-05-baltic-npp-debacle-construction-reported-halted-possibly-mothballed">the construction of a nuclear power plant in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad</a> were political activity.</p>
<p>The group has taken a two-pronged approach to dealing with the foreign agent label.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it continues to try to clear its name in court. On the other, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/russian-human-rights-issues/russian-ngo-law/2016-01-russias-ecodefense-ngo-again-refuses-to-pay-state-ordered-fines-over-its-foreign-agent-status">it continues to refuse to voluntarily register as a foreign agent, and also refuses paying the fines levied against it</a> – a strategy Slivyak said has ironically allowed the group to continue functioning without official interference, for now.</p>
<p>The approach, however, makes it especially vulnerable to a Justice Ministry lawsuit, Slivyak said.</p>
<p>“We understand very well that can happen to Ecodefense and other groups,” he said via email. “We must be prepared for this to happen anytime. It’s just a matter of time, I think.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cause of a surprise reactor shutdown at Russia&#8217;s Kola Nuclear Power Plant’s No 4 reactor on Tuesday was finally explained by the station’s <a href="http://www.kolanpp.rosenergoatom.ru/about/press-center/news/732a72004ba1c5eaaf16ff294acb769f">press service</a> as “deterioration of the insulation of a power cable in the course of conducting scheduled tests on an auxiliary systems’ pump.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2016-02-russias-kola-nuclear-plant-reactor-shut-down-spooks-environmentalists">initial emergency shutdown of the reactor</a> on Tuesday morning at about 9:37 am Moscow time was originally reported without an explanation – something nuclear experts on Russia said is exceedingly rare, and cause for concern.</p>
<p>The reactor’s age and clearances to run above nominal generating capacity near the city of Murmansk added to worries during the day-long silence on why the No 4 unit had been pulled from the grid.</p>
<p>The Kola nuclear plant reported yesterday that the reactor was up and running again by 10:48 am Wednesday, after what the press service indicated was “an elimination of the malfunction” and “checks on the operational capabilities of equipment.”</p>
<p>The Kola plant release continued to say that “switching the reactor off the grid happened in accordance with engineered algorithms: No limits or conditions of safe use were violated.”</p>

	</p>

<p>It added that a preliminary evaluation on the seven-point <a href="http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/emergency/ines.asp">International Nuclear Event</a> scale (INES) assigned the shutdown a “zero,” which indicates an event that, according to the scale, has “no safety significance” for the plant. The station also reported that background radiation levels at the plant and in surrounding areas remain unchanged since before the shutdown.</p>
<p>To what extent the burnt-out cable represents any threats to safety, however, will only be clear after an investigation by a committee to be appointed by Rostekhnadzor, Russia’s Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Oversight.</p>
<p>According to Andrei Ozharovsky, a Moscow-based nuclear adviser with Bellona, such investigations can be protracted for months, and their results aren’t generally made public.</p>
<p>Worries arose about the sudden, and initially unexplained shutdown because of two aspects in the reactor’s operational history.</p>
<p>First, the reactor, which is a VVER- 440 unit, is <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-11-kola-nuke-plant-to-prolong-reactor-operating-times-and-boost-power-output">running on a 25-year engineering lifespan extension</a>, meaning it will not be taken out of service until 2039, when it’s 60 years old.</p>
<p>The unit went online in 1984, and received its current service extension in 2014. Ozharovksy said this extension was granted in the absence of a state environmental impact assessment.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-russia/2012-04-comment-russia-gives-up-on-boosting-chernobyl-type-reactors-but-still-eyes-vver-running-stations-for-further-experiments">the reactor since 2012 has been a part of an experiment</a> to run at various intervals at 107 percent its nominal production capacity. The reactor had also been run at expanded capacities in 1986 and 1987 under Soviet rule, but the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 mothballed that for almost a decade and a half.</p>
<p>Alexander Nikitin, chairman of the Environmental Rights Center Bellona said on Thursday by email that, “it’s not important here how long the reactor has worked or will work – what’s important is that they allowed [such extensions] to begin with.”</p>
<p class="image  align-right">

	</p>

<p>As to the experiments in boosting No 4’s power output, Nikitin said, “Difficulties can arise when a reactor is operated at any power, even at the minimum controllable level – but the official decision to stretch the power output and all other corresponding parameters to above normal, of course, adds to risks.”</p>
<p>Nikitin has in the past indicated that many nations with nuclear power plants routinely experiment with boosting reactor power output levels, not just Russia.</p>
<p>But Ozharovsky said the reactor is lacking in several contemporary safety components, such as appropriate containment and a core catcher to prevent leakages of molten core material in the event of a meltdown. This safety feature has been de rigueur in French reactors since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Kola’s No 4 reactor isn’t the plant’s only reactor that’s operation on borrowed time. Operations for reactors No 1 and 2 were extended to 2018 and 2019, respectively.</p>
<p>But the Kola plant drew up an investment project for operational extensions amounting to a total of 60 years for both these reactors. This means that they could both operate another 15 years on top of the 15-year extensions they’ve already got.</p>
<p>The Kola Nuclear Plant’s No 3 reactor in 2011 r<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rosatom.ru/journalist/news/697881004ba232e3b279fa8170622b38">eceived 5-year operational extension</a>.</p>
<p>The plant is likewise expecting to get the nod to run the No 3 reactor at boosted power outputs of 104 to 107 percent.</p>
<p>The boosted power regimens are not specific to Russia’s Kola nuclear station. Another six of Russia’s 31 reactors are operating above nominal capacity.</p>
<p>VVER-1000 reactors operating at Russia&#8217;s Balakovo, Kaliningrad and Rostov nuclear stations also undergo power boosting experiment to 104 percent over nominal output. Another reactor at the Rostov station may soon be taking part in these experiments as well, as soon as an environmental impact study is approved.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom proposed running Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors at above nominal power output as well. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, however, the plan was scrapped.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bellona strongly welcomes this agreement, and sees it as a catalyst for the uptake of sustainably sourced biofuels, specifically from marine sources. These in turn would be a pre-condition to meeting the cap in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>«<em>This agreement marks a true historic milestone in global efforts to curb aviation emissions, which have seen an alarming upwards trend over the past years. While surely deserving applause, it is important to note what the cap will entail. We, at Bellona, believe it will act to strengthen the drive and need for sustainably sourced biofuels, with marine-grown, third generation biofuels, such as seaweed, holding particularly great potential» </em>reacts Jonas Helseth, Director at Bellona Europa.</p>
<p>European leadership needs to boost investments into the development of non-food biomass feedstocks, which do not compete with other land use including food production, namely marine-based biomass whose sigificant potential is largely unexploited. The sea accounts for 50% of the world’s biomass production, yet on a global basis only 2% of our energy today comes from the sea. Bellona has shared its recommendations for unleashing the true potential of marine biomass in its recent <a href="http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/Bellona-Response-to-EC-Consultation-on-Revision-of-RED-1.pdf">response</a> to the Commission’s consultation on the post-2020 Renewable Energy Directive.</p>
<p><strong>What the cap entails</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rules would limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and strengthen the efficiency of all new commercial and business airliners after 2028 by an average of 4%, however, new large aircraft will have to start complying in 2020. The emission standards, if given final approval later this year, will reduce carbon emissions by 650 million tons between 2020 and 2040, according to calculations of the International Council on Clean Transportation.</p>
<p>The agreed upon cap is not only crucial in the aftermath of COP 21, with the resulting Paris agreement having omitted aviation from its text, but also because of the alarming upward trend of the sector’s emissions.  Between 1990 and 2014 we have observed an 80% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> ­emissions stemming from aircraft. A recent European Commission <a href="http://www.easa.europa.eu/eaer/news/european-commission-press-release">report</a> predicts their share rising by another 45% between 2014 and 2035.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>The emissions cap was unanimously recommended by the 170 international experts on ICAO&#8217;s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP); its ultimate adoption is not to be decided on by the UN agency&#8217;s 36-State Governing Council later this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW ORLEANS – In a surprise move environmentalists are calling ‘misguided,’ a divided US Supreme Court’s nine justices voted 5 to 4 late Tuesday to block key portions of President Barack Obama’s signature Clean Energy Plan to reduce power plant emissions.</p>
<p>The decision could also impair <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-08-19466">American strides</a> toward developing and deploying carbon capture and storage technology, which could have further ripple effects abroad <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2016-01-carbon-capture-and-storage-comeback-must-focus-on-industrial-emissions-say-experts">where the technology’s foothold is precarious</a>. And, explosive new job growth in the solar sector – which now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/national/">employs twice as many people as the coal industry</a> – could come under the gun</p>
<p>Yet the freeze on introducing the plan is poised to make  presidential candidates&#8217; stands on climate change a central issue for the first time in American politics.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court granted a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/020916zr_21p3.pdf">stay request</a> from 29 mostly Republican-led states, plus utilities and coal companies, which said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was overreaching its powers.</p>
<p>The court’s decision does not address the merits of the challenge, but indicates justices think the states have raised serious questions – casting a pall over Obama’s single biggest stride toward forging his environmental legacy.</p>

	</p>

<p>Announced in August, Obama’s <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-08-should-the-new-obama-clean-power-plan-boost-expectations-for-paris">Clean Power Plan </a>–requiring US states to submit plans for shifting away from fossil-fuel power plants in favor of alternative forms of energy to reduce emissions – was a key to establishing US credibility at the UN <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2015-12-paris-climate-deal-unites-world-in-a-common-goal-of-slashing-emissions-for-the-first-time">Paris Climate Summit</a> in December.</p>
<p>By pledging to reduce US carbon emissions by a third under 2005 levels by 2030, the plan is America’s main tool to meet emissions reductions pledges made in Paris.</p>
<p>But the plan was also a ripe target for lawsuits against the EPA, as states challenged the time frame in which they would need to present their alternative energy plans.</p>
<p>Now, fears are high that the Court’s decision could force the US to default on its international climate commitments.</p>
<p>Sirin Engen, an adviser on carbon capture and storage with Bellona said the Supreme Court stay on implementing the plan winds back the clock on US efforts to deal with climate change.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time for partisan conflicts when it comes to fighting climate change, and the Paris Agreement from December 2015 confirms that the entire world understands this and understand its consequences,” she said. “[The court’s decision] adds to a really sad track record for the US when it comes to CO2 emissions reductions.”</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Minority leader in the House of Representatives and a supporter of the Clean Power Plan agreed.</p>
<p>“More than 195 nations have pledged historic action in the Paris Climate Accord and communities across America are leading on clean energy,” she said in a <a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/pelosi-statement-on-supreme-court-stay-of-clean-power-plan-rule/">statement</a>.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court’s deeply misguided decision to stay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan will enable those states that deny climate science to slow progress in reducing the carbon pollution that threatens the health of all Americans,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Dangers to America’s lead in CCS</strong></p>
<p>Bellona’s Engen further said the Supreme Court stay could jam up US efforts in the direction of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), specifically projects in <a href="http://bellona.org/news/climate-change/2014-10-austin-blog-bellona-europas-jonas-helseth-talks-ccs-little-bbq-texas">Texas</a> and <a href="http://bellona.org/news/ccs/2015-06-alabama-and-mississippi-blog-the-south-as-climate-technology-frontrunners">Mississippi</a>.</p>

<p>“The US is, quite surprisingly, is taking a lead in developing the most important technology in fighting global climate change, and this is all thanks to the Clean Power Plan,” she said. “American industry is dependent on CCS if the US is to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.”</p>
<p><strong>Court’s timing could be Obama’s worst enemy</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s order said the administration can petition it to hear the case in full, but that the stay would meanwhile remain in effect. If the court accepts the case, it wouldn’t hand down a ruling on the Clean Power Plan until 2017.</p>
<p>The decision also jeopardizes the plan itself: The stay on implementing plan means questions about its legality will linger until after Obama has left office, opening the door for a new president to make significant changes.</p>
<p>A review of the suits will be heard before the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, but not until June 2.</p>
<p>The Obama administration complained to the Supreme Court that the stay request was unprecedented, and that it was routine for federal programs to proceed while courts considered challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change could become a lightning-rod issue for the first time</strong></p>
<p>With presidential election primary season in full swing, however, climate policy, or lack thereof, could make or break pretenders to Obama&#8217;s office. This month&#8217;s two primaries revealed parties divided.  Ted Cruz, who is competing for the Republican nomination, was a clear winner over blustering real estate mogul Donald Trump in Iowa last week.</p>
<p>Both candidates for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, finished Iowa within 0.3 percentage point of each other, with Clinton in the photo-finish lead. The New Hampshire primary saw Trump surge over Cruz with 35 percent of the vote, and Sanders pulled far ahead of Clinton with 6o percent.</p>
<p>But Sanders and Clinton are united on one thing: The US needs to take more ambitious climate action, and both support major plans for solar and other renewables.  Trump, meanwhile,  theorizes that climate change is a hoax concocted by the Chinese to sabotage US industry, while Cruz said it was cooked up by the American left.</p>
<p>The Republican front-runners&#8217; attitudes to climate change cold hurt them in the general election, a December University of Michigan poll suggested. Seven in 10 Americans at this point believe climate change is a real issue and must be addressed, Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University told the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0cb69230-ad31-11e5-993b-c425a3d2b65a.html#axzz3zo7kBFfR">Financial Times</a> on December 30.</p>
<p><strong>An ‘unprecedented’ stay</strong></p>
<p>White House press secretary Josh Earnest issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/press-secretary-josh-earnest-supreme-courts-decision-stay-clean-power">statement</a> saying the administration doesn’t agree with the court’s ruling.</p>
<p>“We remain confident that we will prevail on the merits,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“Even while the litigation proceeds, EPA has indicated it will work with states that choose to continue plan development and will prepare the tools those states will need. At the same time, the Administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions,” wrote Earnest.</p>

	</p>

<p>According to usual practices for stay requests, the court gave no explanation for its action. The court’s four liberal justices, who voted against the stay, where Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — but offered no statements on their dissent.</p>
<p><strong>What are states challenging? </strong></p>
<p>The Clean Power Plan would force states to reduce their carbon emissions by 32 percent by 2030. It’s been widely described as the most ambitious plan ever by the US government to reduce the impact of climate change by addressing electricity consumption, the number one cause of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The regulation calls for states to submit compliance plans by September, though they may seek extensions until 2018. The first deadline for power plants to reduce their emissions is in 2022, with full compliance not required until 2030.</p>
<p>The initial challenges to the Clean Power Plan came mostly from Republican led states that rely heavily on coal mining or coal fired power.</p>
<p>Their initial request for a stay on the plan’s implementation was unanimously denied by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s willingness to intervene in the case is an ominous sign for supporters of the plan as it suggests there are significant doubts about its legality among the conservative majority of the justices.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number 4 reactor at the Kola Nuclear Power Plant was automatically disconnected from the power grid via an automatic emergency switch-off for reasons that are still under investigation, the station’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rosenergoatom.ru/journalist/news/45c021004b9e3fe4a1fbeb8170622b38">website</a> reported, giving environmentalist pause.</p>
<p>The website reported that no radiation spikes had been detected at the plant, and that background radiation levels in the surrounding area have reportedly remained stable.</p>
<p>The website also said its remaining three reactors were operating as normal. But this has done little to quell puzzlement among nuclear watchers.</p>
<p>Nils Bøhmer, Bellona’s executive director and nuclear physicist told the <a target="_blank" href="http://thebarentsobserver.com/industry/2016/02/reactor-shutdown-kola">Independent Barents Observer</a> news portal that it’s that concerning plant engineers haven’t pinned down a reason behind the shutdown yet, and were unable to give Bellona any further information when the group contacted the plant.</p>
<p>“If it was a simple non-dangerous reason for the shutdown, they would have known it by now,” said Bøhmer. “We have been in contact with the plant and they couldn’t point to any particular reason.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s either a sign that they don’t know, or they don’t want to tell. Both give reason to concern,” said Bøhmer.</p>

	</p>

<p>Andrei Zolotkov, a nuclear adviser with Bellona located in Murmansk, close to the Kola Plant, agreed.</p>
<p>He said in an email interview that the current vacuum of information for the reactor switch-off leaves a lot of room for speculation, as plants “usually provide information on any reason for shut down.”</p>
<p>Zolotkov said that this information is usually rapidly made public.</p>
<p>“In the majority of cases, [the shutdowns] aren’t connected to the reactor’s functioning,” he said. “It will be a breakdown in the turbine generators or the open power switching stations.”</p>
<p>But he said a reactor’s most important functions take place in its first circuit, where the reactor, pumps and steam generators are located.</p>
<p>“[Breakdowns in] these parts are too important to directly inform the media about,” said Zolotkov. “Therefore it can be assumed that something falling outside the usual list of small incidents at a nuclear power plant may have occurred.”</p>
<p>If there is any more concrete information behind the strange occurrence, said Zolotkov, it’s because plant management is not passing it on to the public information service.</p>
<p>“If it turns out that the reason behind the incident is more significant, or gets sloughed off to the category of ‘insignificant’ then the plant’s management will have a lot to answer for,” he said.</p>
<p>The No 4 reactor at the Kola Nuclear plant started operations in 1984. In 2014, <a target="_blank" href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-11-kola-nuke-plant-to-prolong-reactor-operating-times-and-boost-power-output">it received a nearly record-breaking lifespan extension of 25 years run-time beyond its 30-yeear engineered service time</a>. When it shuts down in 2039 it will have been in service for 55 years.</p>
<p>All of the Kola Plants reactors are running on borrowed time. Aside from the extension granted to reactor No 4, operations for reactors No 1 and 2 were extended to 2018 and 2019, respectively. But the Kola plant drew up an investment project for operational extensions amounting to a a total of 60 years, meaning an additional 15 years for each reactor, both of which are currently operating on 15 year service extensions as it is.</p>
<p>The Kola Nuclear Plant’s No 3 reactor in 2011 received an operational extension, also for 25 years, pushing its closure back to 2036.</p>
<p>The reactor was also the subject of an experiment allowing it to operate at 107 percent capacity <a href="http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/nuclear-russia/2012-04-comment-russia-gives-up-on-boosting-chernobyl-type-reactors-but-still-eyes-vver-running-stations-for-further-experiments">beginning in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>Igor Marakulin, the plant’s chief safety engineer, told Bellona in a November interview that the reactor has been run at 104 to 107 percent capacity for 94 days since the experiment began.</p>
<p>The plant currently expects to get permission to run reactor No 3 at the same extended power levels.</p>
<p>Including Reactor No 4 at the Kola plant, six of Russia’s 31 reactors are operating above nominal capacity. All four of the Balakovo nuclear station’s reactors are churning away at 104 percent, and one reactor at the Rostov plant is operating at 107 percent.</p>
